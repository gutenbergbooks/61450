<p class="noi title">DIDO,<br />
THE DANCING BEAR</p>


<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>DIDO CUTS UP</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">In the woods, on top of a mountain, in a far-off
country there once lived a family of
nice bears. I call them nice bears for
they were. Of course they had long claws, and
sharp teeth, but they never bit any one, or
scratched any one, because there were no boys or
girls, or men or women, living in that part of the
woods.</p>

<p>I suppose, though, if a boy went on top of the
mountain, and began throwing stones or sticks
at the nice bears, they might have run out and
scratched him to make him go away. Mind, I’m
not saying for sure, but maybe. But, as I have
said, there were no boys in the woods to bother
the bears who lived all by themselves in a den
among the rocks.</p>

<p>A bear’s house is called a den, because it is such
a nice, cozy, warm place, just as your father or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
brother may have a room of his own, all fixed
up with the things he likes best, and he calls that
his den.</p>

<p>Well, in this den in the woods on top of the
mountain lived the five bears. There was Mr.
Bear, the papa, and Mrs. Bear, the mother, and
there were three little bears, called cubs, just as
little dogs are called puppies.</p>

<p>One little bear was named Gruffo, because he
had such a deep, gruff voice, though it was not at
all cross. And another bear was named Muffo,
because he had such big, soft furry paws that
when he folded them together it looked just as if
he were carrying a muff.</p>

<p>And besides Gruffo and Muffo there was another
bear, the smallest of the three, called Dido.
Now I am going to tell you some of the many
adventures Dido had. Adventures, you know,
are what happen to you.</p>

<p>“Gruffo and Muffo, you must take good care
of your little brother Dido when you go off playing
in the woods,” said Mrs. Bear, for though
the bears could not speak in our language they
had talk of their own which was just as plain to
them as our A B and C talk is to us.</p>

<p>“Take good care of Dido,” Mrs. Bear would
say. “Don’t run away from him, or he might
be lost. And don’t climb big trees and leave
him on the ground, or something might happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to him. And never take him too far out in the
water of the lake when you go swimming, or he
might be drowned.”</p>

<p>“We won’t, Mother,” said Gruffo and Muffo.
“We’ll take good care of Dido.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I can take care of myself,” said
Dido, making a funny face with his queer, black,
rubbery nose.</p>

<p>“Now that wasn’t a nice thing to say,” said
Mrs. Bear, holding up her paw and gently shaking
it at Dido. “You ought to be glad your bigger
brothers will look after you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so I am, Mother,” answered Dido. “I’m
sorry I spoke that way. May they take me
swimming now, down to the lake?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” answered Mrs. Bear. “Run
along, little cubs. I have to go out and see if I
can find some berries or sweet roots for your dinner.”</p>

<p>Bears, you know, like to eat berries and the
sweet roots of some trees and bushes. Bears also
like fish, and honey. Say! if ever you have a
pet bear, which might some day happen, you
know, and you want to give him a special extra
treat, just bring him some honey. He will love
it so much that he will eat every bit of it up, box
and all!</p>

<p>So while Dido, with his brothers Gruffo and
Muffo, walked on along the mountain path to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
lake, Mrs. Bear went off in the woods to find
some roots and berries for dinner. Of course the
little bears might have been able to find some
for themselves, but you know how it is with children.
Even though they know where the things
are to eat they like their mother to get a meal for
them.</p>

<p>“I can run faster than you can!” cried Dido to
his two brothers, as they went along through the
woods. “Look!” And off he started, swinging
from side to side, brushing the bushes out of his
way as he went.</p>

<p>“Pooh! I can go faster than that!” called
Gruffo in his deep voice. “Watch me!”</p>

<p>Then he began to run, and, as he was bigger
than Dido, of course he ran faster, and soon
passed him.</p>

<p>“I can beat you, Gruffo!” cried Muffo.
“See!” Then Muffo ran, and of course he easily
ran ahead of the other two bear cubs.</p>

<p>“Let’s have another race,” said Dido, a little
later. “I think I can beat you both then,” and
slipping up behind Gruffo he began tickling him
in his ear with a piece of tree branch.</p>

<p>“Ouch! What’s that, a bee?” cried Gruffo,
brushing his ear with his paw, for his ear tickled.
He did not see what Dido was doing.</p>

<p>“Let me alone, bee!” growled Gruffo. “That
is, unless you will show me the hollow tree where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
you have some honey,” went on the bear cub.
“If you do that you may tickle me all you
please!”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed Muffo at the funny way
Dido was tickling Gruffo. “Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho!”
and he nearly fell down, he laughed so hard.</p>

<p>Of course I don’t mean to say that bears laugh
as we do, but they have their own way of making
fun and laughing at it. So when I say, in this
story, that a bear laughs, or talks or does anything,
I mean he does it in a bear’s way, and not
in our way.</p>

<p>“Where is that bee?” asked Gruffo. And
then, as he heard Muffo laughing, and Dido giggling,
Gruffo turned quickly and saw that it was
his little brother tickling him in the ear with the
stick.</p>

<p>“Here, you stop that!” cried Gruffo, and he
reached out his paw to catch Dido. But Dido
jumped back, and so quickly that he tripped over
a tree root, and down he went, turning a back
somersault.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho!” laughed Gruffo this
time. “That was very funny, Dido. Do it
again!”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Dido, “I will not, if you
please. I did not do it on purpose, and besides,
I bumped my nose when I fell.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too bad!” said Gruffo, for he remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
what his mother had said about looking
after little Dido. “I’m sorry you hurt your
nose,” went on Gruffo. “Still, if you had not
tickled me you would not have fallen. Never
mind, here is some soft mud you can hold on
your nose, that will make it well.”</p>

<p>From a wet place, near a spring of water,
Gruffo took up some soft mud, and put it on his
little brother’s nose.</p>

<p>“Does that make the pain better?” asked
Gruffo.</p>

<p>“Lots better, thank you,” answered Dido.
For it is true that bears and other animals use
mud as we do plaster and poultices. If ever
your dog gets stung by a bee on the nose, you
watch him hunt for some soft mud to put on the
stinging place.</p>

<p>“Well, come on if we’re going swimming,”
said Muffo, after a bit.</p>

<p>So the three bears went on through the woods
on the mountain, until they came to the lake,
where the water was blue and clear and cold.
Without stopping to take off any clothes (for of
course they did not wear any), the three bears
plunged into the water and began swimming
about. Bears love to play in the water, and that
is why, in parks and other places where they
keep tame bears, there is always a pool of water
for them to splash in. And sometimes there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
wooden ball in the water for the bears to play
with, too, for bears love to play.</p>

<p>“Watch me dive!” cried Dido, and down he
went under the water. Up he came, a little
later, right near Muffo, and with his paw Dido
splashed some water in Muffo’s face.</p>

<p>“Say, you’re cutting up a lot to-day, Dido!”
cried Muffo. “What makes you do so many
tricks?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just feel happy!” cried Dido, gayly.</p>

<p>Then he swam about some more, splashing in
the water of the lake, and lapping some water
with his red tongue.</p>

<p>“I wish we could catch some fish,” said Gruffo,
after a bit. “I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Muffo. “Let’s go fishing.”</p>

<p>“I’m coming, too,” said Dido.</p>

<p>The bears came up out of the water, with their
fur dripping wet, and started to go fishing.
They did not need poles or lines or hooks. All
they had to do was to sit on a log, near the lake,
and when, by looking down, they saw a fish
swimming along they just put their claws quickly
in and pulled the fish out. It was very easy for
them, but it would have been hard for you or me.</p>

<p>“Ha! I see a fish!” suddenly cried Dido.
“Watch me catch him!”</p>

<p>Down into the water he thrust his paw. But
something was wrong. Either Dido did not see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the fish, and only thought he did, or he went
after it too quickly. For he reached over too
far, and the next thing he knew he was splashing
in the lake again. He had fallen in.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” laughed Muffo. “That’s a queer
way to fish, Dido.”</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t meant to do that!” spluttered
Dido, as he crawled out on the bank.</p>

<p>“Try again,” said Gruffo, as he helped his little
brother out on the log. “Maybe next time
you will catch one. Now you watch how I do
it,” for Gruffo knew that Dido was little, and
had many things to learn that bears must know
if they are to get along in the woods.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Gruffo saw a big fish, and with
one scoop of his paw he landed it on the bank.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s a fine one!” cried Dido. “I wish
I could catch one like that.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you some of this,” said Gruffo
kindly. “There is enough for all of us.”</p>

<p>Then he divided the fish with his two brothers,
and they ate it, not stopping to cook it as we
would have to do. Bears like their meat and
fish without being cooked.</p>

<p>After they had eaten the fish, and had swam
in the lake to wash their paws and faces, the
three bears went back to the den in the rocks.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother, we had such fun!” cried Dido.
Then he saw his father asleep in the sun, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
taking up a leafy branch Dido went softly over
and began to tickle Mr. Bear on the nose.</p>

<p>“Wuff! Ker-choo!” sneezed Mr. Bear.
“What’s that; a fly?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s just Dido,” said Mrs. Bear. “He’s
cutting up again. You must not be too funny,”
she went on, shaking her paw at her little bear
cub, “or some day something may happen to
you.”</p>

<p>And one day something did happen to Dido.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>DIDO IS CAUGHT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">One nice, warm sunny day, when it was
too hot to stay inside the den among the
rocks, the nice bears were all out in
front, lying in the shade of the woods.</p>

<p>“Oh, my! How hot it is!” cried Dido, and he
opened his mouth wide, and let his red tongue
hang out, for animals, such as dogs and bears,
cool themselves off that way. You must have
seen your dog, when he had run fast, after a cat,
perhaps, open his mouth and breathe fast, with
his tongue hanging out.</p>

<p>“Let’s go swimming in the lake again!” cried
Dido to his brothers.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Gruffo.</p>

<p>“We’ll all go,” said Mr. Bear. “Come
along.”</p>

<p>So off through the woods walked the family
of bears toward the cool, blue lake, high up in
the mountains. Dido could hardly wait to get
there, and as soon as he saw, through the trees,
the sparkle of the water he began to run. He
ran so fast that he stumbled over a stone, and fell
down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Dido!” called his mother. “You must
be more careful. You must not go so fast.
Something will happen to you some day if you
do not look where you are going.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hurt myself that time, anyhow,” answered
Dido, as he got up, and jumped into the
lake. There he swam about, as did the father
and mother bear, and the other two cubs. Dido
splashed his brothers every time he came near
them, but they did not mind, for he was such a
cute little fellow and he meant no harm. Besides,
it was so warm that the more water they
had on them the better Gruffo and Muffo
liked it.</p>

<p>“It makes me hungry to go in swimming,”
said Mrs. Bear. “I am going off in the woods
to look for some berries.”</p>

<p>“I’m coming, too,” said Dido. “For I am
hungry myself.”</p>

<p>Soon Mrs. Bear found a bush on which were
growing some big red berries. These she pulled
off with her forepaws, which were, to her, almost
like our hands are to us, and the mother
bear filled her mouth with the fruit. Dido did
the same, and soon he was not as hungry as he
had been. Then along came Mr. Bear, with
Gruffo and Muffo, and they, too, ate the red berries
off the bushes.</p>

<p>All at once Mr. Bear stopped eating, and, lifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
his nose up in the air, sniffed very hard two
or three times.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Mrs. Bear
quickly.</p>

<p>“I think I smell a man,” answered the papa
bear. “See if you can smell anything.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bear lifted her nose up in the air and
she, also, sniffed. Bears, you know, as do most
wild animals, use their noses as much as they do
their eyes to tell when there is danger. And to
wild animals a man, nearly always, means danger.
If you were out in the woods, and could
not see any one, you could not tell, just by smelling
the air, whether some person was near you
or not—that is, unless they had a lot of perfume
on them, and then, if the wind was blowing toward
you, why you might smell that.</p>

<p>But bears have much better noses for smelling
than have we, and they can smell a man in the
woods even if he has no cologne on him.</p>

<p>“Sniff! Sniff!” went Mr. Bear.</p>

<p>“Sniff! Sniff!” went Mrs. Bear.</p>

<p>“Yes, I can surely smell a man,” the papa bear
said in a low voice. “It is the first time I have
known them to come around here.”</p>

<p>“And so can I smell a man,” added Mrs. Bear.
“We had better get away from here.”</p>

<p>Then the bears ran off through the woods to
their den. For though big bears are very strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and can fight well, they would much rather run
away from a man than fight him, unless they find
they can not get away. For when a man goes
into the woods where there are bears he nearly
always has a gun with him, and while bears
know they are stronger than a man they also
know that a gun is stronger than a dozen bears.</p>

<p>When Dido, with his brothers and father and
mother, got back to the den in the rocks, the little
bear cub saw that his father was worried about
something. Mr. Bear walked up and down in
front of the pile of rocks, sniffing the air, and
looking on all sides.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Papa?” asked Dido, in
bear talk, of course.</p>

<p>“It’s that man I smelled in the woods,” said
Mr. Bear. “I fear he may find our den.”</p>

<p>“Well, what if he does?” asked Dido.</p>

<p>“Then it would not be safe for us to stay here,”
answered Mrs. Bear. “If men are coming into
our woods it is time for us to go away.”</p>

<p>“What! go away from our nice den?” asked
Gruffo. For though the den was only a hole
in the rocks, with a pile of leaves in one corner
for a bed, still, to the bears, it was as much a
home as your house is to you.</p>

<p>“Yes, it would not be safe to stay while men
are around,” said Mr. Bear. “That is the first
time I have ever smelled them in our woods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Though a friend of mine, Mr. Lion, who lives
farther down the mountain, said he has often
seen men near his cave. Once some men on elephants
chased him, but he got away.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen a man?” asked Dido of
his father.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, often, but always afar off. And the
men did not see me.”</p>

<p>“What does a man look like?” asked Dido, for
he had never seen any, though he had heard of
them.</p>

<p>“A man is a queer creature,” said Mr. Bear.
“He walks up on his hind feet, as we do sometimes,
but when he walks on his four feet he can
only go slowly, like a baby. Even you could
run away from a man on his four feet, Dido.”</p>

<p>“How queer!” said the little bear.</p>

<p>“But don’t try it,” said Mrs. Bear quickly.
“Keep away from men, Dido, for they might
shoot you with one of their guns.”</p>

<p>“What else is a man like?” the little bear
asked.</p>

<p>“Well, he has a skin that he can take off and
put on again,” said Mr. Bear.</p>

<p>“Oh, how very funny!” cried Dido. “Take
off his skin? I should think it would hurt!”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to,” said the papa bear. “I
don’t understand how they do it, but they do.”</p>

<p>Of course what Mr. Bear thought was skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
was a man’s clothes, which he takes off and puts
on again. But though bears are very wise and
smart in their own way, they don’t know much
about men, except to be afraid of them.</p>

<p>“I do not like it that men are coming up in
our woods,” said Mr. Bear. “It means danger.
So be careful, Dido, and you, too, Gruffo and
Muffo, that you do not go too far away. Perhaps
the man has come up here to set a trap to
catch us.”</p>

<p>“What is a trap?” asked Dido.</p>

<p>“It is something dangerous, to catch bears,”
his mother told him. “Some traps are made of
iron, and they have sharp teeth in them that
catch bears by the leg and hurt very much.
Other traps are like a big box, made of logs. If
you go in one of these box traps the door will
shut and you can not get out.”</p>

<p>“What happens then?” asked Dido.</p>

<p>“Then the man comes and gets you.”</p>

<p>“And what does he do with you?” the little
bear cub wanted to know.</p>

<p>“That I can not say,” answered Mrs. Bear.
“Perhaps your father knows.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bear shook his head.</p>

<p>“All I know,” he answered, “is that the man
takes you away if he finds you in his trap. But
where he takes you I do not know, for I was
never caught, and I hope I never will be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope so, too,” said Dido, and he sniffed the
air to see if he could smell the man, but he could
not.</p>

<p>For a number of days after that the bears did
not go far from their den in the rocks. They
were afraid the man might shoot them.</p>

<p>But, after a while, all the berries and sweet
roots close by had been eaten, and the bears had
to go farther off. Besides, they wanted some
fish, and they must go to the lake or river to
catch them. So after Mr. Bear had carefully
sniffed the air, and had not smelled the man-smell,
the bears started off through the woods
again to get something to eat.</p>

<p>Dido ran here and there, sometimes on ahead
and again he would stay behind, slipping up
back of his brothers to tickle them. Oh, but
Dido was a jolly little bear, always looking for
fun.</p>

<p>The bears found some more red berries, and a
few blue ones, and some sweet roots, and they
also caught some fish, which made a good dinner
for them. Then they went swimming in the
lake again before going back to their den.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, when Gruffo was asleep in
the shade, Dido went softly up to him, and
poured a paw full of water in his brother’s ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_24">But Dido climbed up a tree to get away.</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wuff! Ouch! What’s that? Is it raining?”
cried Gruffo, suddenly waking up. Then
he saw that Dido had played the trick on him,
and he ran after the little bear. <a href="#i_p023">But Dido
climbed up a tree to get away</a>, and he did it in
such a funny way, his little short tail going
around like a Fourth of July pinwheel, that
Gruffo had to sit down and laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are such a funny cut-up bear!” he
said, laughing harder than ever, and when a bear
laughs he can’t very well climb a tree.</p>

<p>“Come on down, I won’t do anything to you,”
said Gruffo, after a while, so Dido came down.
Then he turned somersaults on a pile of soft
leaves. Next he stood on his hind legs, and began
striking at a swinging branch of a tree with
his front paws, as you have seen a kitten play
with a cord of a window curtain.</p>

<p>“Dido is getting to be a real cute little cub,”
said Mrs. Bear.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, Dido struck at the tree
branch, but he did not hit it and he fell over
backward.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Mr. Bear. “You’ll hurt
yourself, Dido.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hurt myself that time,” said the little
bear, “for I fell on some soft, green moss.”</p>

<p>“Well, there will not always be moss for you
to fall on,” his mother said. “So look out.”</p>

<p>One day, when Mr. Bear came back from a
long trip in the woods, he brought some wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
honey in his paws. And oh! how good it tasted
to Dido and Gruffo and Muffo!</p>

<p>“Show me where the bee-tree is, Papa,”
begged Dido. “I want to get some more
honey.”</p>

<p>“It is too far away,” answered the papa bear.
“Besides, I saw a man in the woods as I was getting
the honey out of a hollow tree. It would
not be safe for you to go near it when men are
around.”</p>

<p>But the honey tasted so good to Dido that the
little bear cub made up his mind that he simply
must have more.</p>

<p>“I know what I’ll do,” he said to himself.
“When none of the others are watching me I am
going off by myself in the woods and look for a
bee-tree to get some honey. I don’t believe
there’s any danger.”</p>

<p>So about a week after this, one day, Dido saw
his two brothers asleep outside the den. Mr.
Bear had gone off to the lake, perhaps to catch
some fish, and Mrs. Bear was in the den, stirring
up the leaves that made the bed, so it would be
softer to lie on.</p>

<p>“Now’s my chance,” thought Dido, in the way
bears have of thinking. “I’ll just slip off in the
woods by myself, and find a honey-tree. I’ll
bring some honey home, too,” said Dido, for he
was not a selfish little bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Walking softly, so as not to awaken his brothers,
and so his mother, making the leaf-bed in the
den, would not know what he was doing, away
slipped Dido to the woods.</p>

<p>He shuffled along, now and then finding some
red berries to eat, or a bit of sweet root, and
every little while he would lift his nose up in the
air, as he had seen his father do, and sniff to see
if he could smell a man-smell.</p>

<p>“But I don’t smell any,” said Dido. “I guess
it’s all right.”</p>

<p>Then, all at once, he felt a little wind blowing
toward him, and on the breeze came the nicest
smell.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s honey!” cried Dido. “It’s honey! I
have found the honey-tree! Oh, how glad I
am!”</p>

<p>He hurried on through the woods, coming
nearer and nearer to the honey smell all the
while, until, after a bit, he saw in among the
trees something square, like a box, made of little
logs piled together. And inside the thing like a
box was a pile of honey. Dido could see it and
smell it. But he did not rush up in a great
hurry.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t look like the honey-tree father
told about,” the little bear cub thought. “He
said he had to climb a tree. This honey is low
down. Still it is honey, so this must be a honey-tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and if it is low down so much the better for
me. I will not have to climb.”</p>

<p>Dido sniffed the air again. He wanted to see
if there was a man-smell about. But all he
could smell was the honey.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess it’s all right,” said the bear cub.
“I’m so hungry for that honey I can’t wait!
Here I go!”</p>

<p>Dido fairly ran into the box and began to eat
the honey on the floor of it. But, no sooner had
he taken a bite, than suddenly a queer thing happened.</p>

<p><em>Bang!</em> went something behind Dido, and when
he looked around he saw that the box was shut
tight. A sliding door had fallen down and poor
Dido was a prisoner.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>DIDO IS TRAINED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">For a moment Dido was so frightened that
he did not know what to do. His heart
beat very fast, just as you can feel your
kittie’s heart beat fast after a dog has chased her.
The little bear cub stopped eating the honey,
good as it was, and he looked carefully around
him.</p>

<p>“I wonder what has happened to me?” mused
Dido.</p>

<p>He soon guessed. For when he tried to get
out the same way he had come in, he found he
could not. A heavy door of logs had fallen
down, and push as hard as he could, Dido could
not open it.</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” whined the little bear cub. “I
guess I am in one of those traps papa told about.
This must be a box trap. But how did the honey
get here? That is caught, too.”</p>

<p>Thinking of the honey made Dido hungry for
some more, so he ate a little.</p>

<p>Then Dido tried again to get out, scratching
with his strong little claws on the log sides of
the big box. But Dido could not get out that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
way any more than he could break through the
thick door. Soon the little bear cub was very
much frightened, and he cared no more for the
honey, though there was some left.</p>

<p>“Oh dear! Oh dear!” thought Dido. “I
have done something very wrong. I ought not
to have gone off in the woods by myself. Papa
said there might be traps, but I did not think this
was one. I did not sniff the man-smell, I only
smelled the honey.”</p>

<p>Poor, foolish Dido! That was why the man
who had set the trap had put the honey in it—so
the bear, if one came along, would smell that
sweet stuff and not notice the man-odor.</p>

<p>With his heart beating faster than ever, Dido
now ran around all sides of the box-trap, trying
to find a way out. But there was none. He
could look through the cracks between the logs,
and see the green woods where he had walked
along so freely only a little while before. But
now Dido could not get out to climb a tree or do
anything else.</p>

<p>“Oh, what will happen to me?” he asked himself.
“I must get out! I must get out!”</p>

<p>But Dido could not. He grew tired of running
around the cage, and pushing on the sides
and doors. His paws ached. His tongue was
hanging out like a dog’s, and his breath came
fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll lie down and rest,” said Dido. “Perhaps
by then my papa or mamma will come and look
for me and let me out.”</p>

<p>So Dido rested and then he ate a little more of
the honey. It did not taste as nice now, for he
was in trouble, and when even a bear is in trouble
he can not eat well.</p>

<p>Dido waited and waited, but no papa or
mamma bear came for him. It is true that Mr.
Bear and Mrs. Bear soon missed their little cub,
and they went looking for him, but I will tell
you about that part later on.</p>

<p>All at once Dido, in the trap, heard the voices
of some men talking. He knew they must be
men, for he had heard his father tell about them.
And Dido also noticed the man-smell coming to
him through the cracks in the trap. He could
smell that queer smell now, even though he was
close to the honey.</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried one man. “The trap is closed!
There must be a bear in it!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure,” said another man.
“Maybe he got out.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, if I only <em>could</em> get out,” thought
Dido, though he did not know what the men
said. Later on he was to learn to know man-talk,
though he could never speak it himself.
Just as your dog knows what you say when you
call him to come to you, or to run home, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
your dog can not speak to you, except by barking,
which, I suppose, is a sort of dog language.</p>

<p>Anyhow, Dido heard the men talking, even if
he did not know what they said. They hurried
up to the trap, as Dido could see, and one looked
in through a crack.</p>

<p>“We’ve caught a bear!” cried the first man.
“We really have!”</p>

<p>“Have we?” asked the other. “That’s good.”</p>

<p>“But he’s an awful little one,” said the first
man.</p>

<p>“Never mind, he’ll grow fast enough,” the
second man said. “And they are easier to train
to dance when they are little.”</p>

<p>“What funny things those men are saying,”
thought Dido. “I wonder if they are talking
about me? Maybe they will let me out.”</p>

<p>But the men did not seem to be going to do
that. They walked all around the trap, looking
carefully at it.</p>

<p>“He can’t get out,” said the big man, for Dido
could see that one man was tall, and the other
short, just as Dido’s father was larger than he.
“He can’t get out of the trap,” said the big man,
“and we can pick it up, with him in it, and carry
it away. If we had caught a bigger bear we
could not do that.”</p>

<p>“That honey you put in the trap made good
bait,” said the short man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought it would,” replied the other.
“Bears will go almost anywhere to get honey.
And as soon as this one went in and began eating,
he loosened the rope that held up the door,
and it fell down. That’s how he was caught.”</p>

<p>Dido did not understand all this talk, but he
wished, with all his heart, that he had not gone
in to eat the honey.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said the big man, “we’ll carry the
cage-trap out to the road and put it on the
wagon. Then, in a few days, I will begin to
teach this bear to dance.”</p>

<p>Dido ran around in the cage or trap once
more, trying to get out, but he could not. And
the next thing he knew he felt himself being
lifted up and carried along. This frightened
him more than ever, but there was nothing he
could do, for he could not get out. He could
smell the man-smell very plainly now, for the
men were walking along close to the trap, carrying
it.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Dido could see, through the
cracks, that the woods were not as thick as they
had been. He was being taken away from his
beloved forest where he had lived all his short
life. He was being taken away from the den-house,
and from his father and mother and
brothers.</p>

<p>And, even though Dido was only a bear he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
felt badly, as all animals do when they are taken
to a new and strange place.</p>

<p>“If ever I get out of this trap,” thought Dido,
“I’ll bite and scratch those men until they let me
go.”</p>

<p>Biting and scratching comes natural to bears,
as it does to some cats, you know, and you could
hardly find fault with Dido for wanting to get
loose. He did not learn, until afterward, that
the men were going to be kind to him.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Dido felt his trap being lifted up.
Then it was set down on a wagon, and horses began
to draw it down the mountain to the place
where the trappers lived. For the two men
were trappers, and they set traps in the woods
to catch wild animals, which they trained to do
tricks and sold to circuses, or to persons who
wanted them. Dido did not learn until afterward
what horses were, but he knew they must
be strong animals to pull a heavy wagon and the
two men and himself in the log-trap.</p>

<p>How long he rode on the wagon Dido did not
know, but after a while he felt himself being
lifted up again and he was carried into a queer
place. Though the little bear cub did not know
what it was he found out later that it was a barn.
It was dark in there, almost as dark as in the
woods at night, but Dido was not afraid of the
dark. He rather liked it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you going to take the little bear out of
the trap?” asked the little man.</p>

<p>“Not right away,” answered the big man. “I
will first let him get quiet. I want to tame him
a bit so he will not bite. I won’t give him anything
to eat or drink for a long while, and then
he will be so hungry and thirsty that he will not
be afraid when I come near to give him something.”</p>

<p>And that is just what happened to Dido. The
sweet honey had made him thirsty, and he was
very warm from having tried so hard to get out
of the trap. Oh! how he wanted a drink of water
from the cool, blue lake! But there was no
water in the cage-trap.</p>

<p>Finally Dido fell asleep. When he opened
his eyes again he could see a little light shining
through the chinks of the trap. Then he
smelled the man-smell again, and he heard the
big man say:</p>

<p>“Well, I wonder how my little bear is to-day?”</p>

<p>Dido growled, as all wild bears do when first
they know a man is near them.</p>

<p>“Not very tame yet, I guess,” the man said.
“But you soon will be, when you get hungrier
and more thirsty.”</p>

<p>Dido thought he never had been so thirsty.
His mouth was hot, and his tongue was dry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
That was worse than being hungry. All day
long he had no water, though he whined for it
as he had whined when he was a little baby bear
and wanted his mother to feed him.</p>

<p>On the second day the big man opened a little
hole in the trap. Dido quickly put out his head—that
was all he could put out. The man
reached his hand toward Dido, who growled
good and hard.</p>

<p>“Quiet now! Quiet!” said the man. “I
won’t hurt you. Here is some water for you to
drink.” He put down a basin of water where
Dido could reach it, and the smell of that water
was so good to Dido that he drank it even while
the man was standing near. And as the bear
drank the man patted him on the head and spoke
softly to him. This time Dido did not growl,
for he liked to be petted. But, best of all, he
liked the water.</p>

<p>Then the hole in the cage was closed again,
and Dido was left alone. He was getting quite
hungry now, but there was nothing to eat. He
had eaten all the honey, and licked clean the
boards where it had been.</p>

<p>“Oh, how I wish I had some red berries or
sweet roots,” thought the little bear cub. And
just then he smelled something that made his
nose quiver. It was fish.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wonder if my father has come for me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and brought me a fish from the blue lake?”
Dido asked himself.</p>

<p>But when the little hole in the trap was opened
Dido saw the big man. Dido growled, and then
he was sorry, for he saw the man holding out a
piece of fish to him.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll soon be tame,” said the man.
“Come now, be a nice bear.” Then Dido ate
the fish, and had more water to drink.</p>

<p>For nearly a week Dido was kept in the cage.
Each day the man came to feed and water him,
and the man always patted the bear cub on the
head and spoke kindly to him. After a while
Dido did not mind the man-smell at all. He
got rather to like it, and to like the man who fed
him. So that, in a few days, when the man
opened the big door of the trap, and let Dido
come out, the bear cub did not try to run away.</p>

<p>For he saw no place to which he could run.
There were no woods, just a big barn, the doors
of which were closed. Besides, Dido thought
if he ran away he would get no more fish or
water.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll put a collar on you, with a chain,
so you won’t get lost, and then I’ll begin to train
you to dance,” said the big man.</p>

<p>Dido felt something being fastened around his
neck. He did not mind very much, for, at the
same time, the man gave him something new to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
eat. It was soft and white and tasted rather
sweet, though not as sweet as honey.</p>

<p>“Oh, but that is good!” thought Dido. The
man had given him a chunk of bread, which
bears like very much. When he had eaten the
bread Dido looked around for more, and he took
another piece from the man’s hand, and did not
growl or bite. Dido was getting tame, you see.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>DIDO LEARNS TO DANCE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“You are a very nice, good, little bear,
and I think you will soon learn to
dance,” said the man as he rubbed
Dido on the head, and gave him some water to
drink, after Dido had eaten the bread. “Yes, I
must soon start teaching you to dance.”</p>

<p>Of course Dido did not understand this talk—that
is not all of it, but he knew the man was
speaking kindly to him, for he could tell by the
way his voice sounded. Just as your dog can
tell when you speak kindly to him, or when you
are cross. If you speak nicely to your dog, and
call him a good fellow, he will wag his tail, to
show how glad he is. But when you are cross—Oh!
how the dog’s tail drops down between his
legs, and how sadly he looks up at you.</p>

<p>Of course Dido was not quite as tame as a dog,
but he was beginning to learn that the man
would not hurt him, and that he would be kind
to him. So Dido thought he would be good
himself, and not growl, bite or scratch.</p>

<p>For two or three days more Dido was kept in
the barn, being chained to a post, with a leather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
collar around his neck. Dido did not like this
collar. He had never worn one before, and did
not know what it was. In the woods bears
never wear collars, any more than they do neckties.
Of course, in a circus, a keeper, or trainer,
might dress up a bear in real clothes, with a collar
and tie, just for fun.</p>

<p>Dido did not like the collar around his neck,
and he pawed and scratched, trying to get it off.
It was fastened on too snugly, however, and
would not come loose.</p>

<p>“Let it alone, Dido,” said the man who was to
be the little bear cub’s keeper. “The collar will
not hurt you, and I must keep it on so I can lead
you around by a chain, or rope, when we go
traveling, and you show the people how well you
can dance.”</p>

<p>Dido did not understand all this talk, but
when he found he could not get the collar off he
stopped trying to loosen it. And he very soon
found that, though it felt queer at first, it did not
hurt him, just as the man had said.</p>

<p>Every day Dido was given nice things to eat—big
chunks of bread, sometimes a bit of fish, and
once he had a sweet bun with currants on top.
Oh! that was very good!</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t so bad being caught in a trap,”
thought Dido, after a bit. “I have better things
to eat here than I did in the den at home, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
do not have to go after them. The man brings
them to me. I guess men are not as bad as my
papa and mamma thought.”</p>

<p>Of course Dido’s keeper was good to him, for
the man wanted to train the little bear to dance,
and you can not make wild animals learn anything
except by being kind to them. But I suppose
all men might not have been as good as the
one who had caught Dido, so I guess the papa
and mamma bear were right in being afraid of
men, and in teaching their children bears to beware
of the man-smell.</p>

<p>“Yes, I like it here very much,” thought Dido,
as he walked around in the barn as far as his
chain would let him, and ate a bit of sweet
cracker which the man threw to him. “But I
would like a swim in the cold blue lake.”</p>

<p>Then he remembered his brothers, Gruffo and
Muffo, and Dido was lonesome and homesick.
He wished very much that he might go back to
the woods again, and run about under the trees,
and perhaps find a honey-tree. If Dido had
been a boy or girl I suppose he would have cried,
but bears do not know how to do that, which,
perhaps, is just as well. But, at any rate, Dido
was lonesome, and most especially for the blue
lake, for he did want to swim so he might make
himself nice and clean.</p>

<p>And then, one day, Dido saw the big man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the little man bringing in the barn a big tub.
This they filled with water.</p>

<p>“Ha! Now the little bear can have a swim,”
said the big man. “Jump in, Dido, and have a
bath.”</p>

<p>Dido smelled the water. He lapped up some
with his red tongue, and, though it was not quite
as nice as the water of the blue lake high up in
the mountains, still it was very good.</p>

<p>“Wuff!” cried Dido, which was his way of
saying “Fine!” and then <a href="#i_p043">into the tub of water he
jumped with a splash</a>. Oh! how good it felt to
be washed!</p>

<p>“Now come out in the sun and dry yourself,”
said the big man, and he led Dido out of the barn
by the chain. It was the first time Dido had
been out in the open air since he had been caught.
He could feel the warm wind blowing on him,
he could see the sun and the green trees, for
there were trees near the trainer’s barn, though
not so many as in the woods.</p>

<p>Dido felt so jolly at being out in the air that
he almost thought he was back in his own forest
again, and as he remembered Gruffo and Muffo,
and his father and mother, he wanted so much to
see them that he started to run.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! You mustn’t do that!” said the big
man, kindly. “I don’t want you to run away
from me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>And Dido could not run away, for he was
held fast by the collar about his neck and the
chain fastened to the collar. Dido ran as far as
the chain would let him, and then he came to
such a sudden stop that he turned a somersault,
head over heels, as he used to do in front of the
rocky den, when his mother would laugh at
him.</p>

<p>The man had fastened the chain to a post in the
barnyard and Dido could not get away. He felt
a little choked and out of breath as he got up
from having turned the somersault, and he
looked at the man in a queer way, with his eyes
partly shut.</p>

<p>“There, you see,” spoke the keeper. “You
can’t get away, Dido, and you might as well
learn that first as last. I don’t want you to go
away, and I will be kind and good to you. I
will feed you all you want to eat, and you will
have a nice place to sleep—just as nice as you
had in the woods. And when you learn to dance
you and I will travel all around the country, and
the people will give me pennies to see you do
your tricks. So be a good little bear, and do not
try to run away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<div id="i_p043" class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Dido, even yet, did not know all the man said,
of course, but the little bear cub found he could
not get away, so he sat down and looked around.
It was good to be out of doors, anyhow. Then
the man moved a sort of little house, like a
dog kennel, up near Dido. This was for the
bear to sleep in nights, or go in out of the rain.
The little house was in the shade, but Dido’s
chain was long enough so he could walk over in
the sun to get dry after his bath.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I shall like it here,” said Dido
to himself, in the way bears have of talking. “I
used to have lots of fun with my brothers in the
woods, but we never had as many nice things to
eat as I have here, and I have a little house all
my own. Yes, I think I shall like it here, and
I will not run away from the man.”</p>

<p>Dido was getting very tame, you see.</p>

<p>Dido had been living out of doors for about
a week, chained to a post, going in his little
house nights, and in that time several other men
came to look at him. They talked with Dido’s
keeper, and one man told about a big bear he
had caught in the woods.</p>

<p>“My! I wonder if that could be my father
or mother?” thought Dido, who, by this time,
could understand man-talk a little better. But
there was no way of knowing whether or not it
was his father or mother who had been caught.</p>

<p>One day Dido’s master brought out some sweet
buns, and said:</p>

<p>“Now I think it is time you learned to dance.
Come, Dido, let me see if you know how. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
I blow a tune on my horn lift up your paws and
dance around. Come now!”</p>

<p>The man loosed Dido’s chain from the post,
and led the little bear cub out into a nice grassy
place, where the sun shone through the trees.
Then the keeper put a horn to his lips and blew
a jolly tune on it. At first Dido was a bit frightened
at the music, but soon he found it was not
going to hurt him, and then he rather liked it.
Nearly all animals like music, though the way
some dogs howl when you blow on a mouth organ,
or play a fiddle, is queer, I think. Perhaps
the dogs think they are singing.</p>

<p>Anyhow, Dido liked the horn-music which the
man blew, but still Dido did not know anything
about dancing, although he stood up on his hind
legs.</p>

<p>“But I will teach you,” said the man.</p>

<p>He tied one string on Dido’s left hind leg, and
another string on his right leg. Then the man
called to two boys to help him.</p>

<p>“Now when I blow the horn,” said the man,
“first pull on one string and then on the other.
That will pull Dido’s legs a little, and soon he
will know that he must lift them up, first one,
then the other. And pretty soon he will learn
to do it without any strings—just by hearing the
music.”</p>

<p>The man again blew on his horn, but Dido<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
did not dance. Then the little bear cub felt a
pull on his left hind leg, as he was standing up
straight, for he did not have to be taught to do
this. And of course when Dido felt the pull on
his leg he lifted it up.</p>

<p>“That’s the way!” cried the man, and he tooted
a merry tune. “Now pull the other string,
boy!”</p>

<p>The boy did, and Dido lifted up his other leg.
Then came a pull on the one he had lifted before,
and soon Dido was lifting first one hind
leg, and then the other, going around in a circle
as the man gently pulled him by the chain fastened
to the collar.</p>

<p>All this while the man played music on the
horn, and Dido liked it more and more. Soon
he noticed that as the music went fast he was
lifting his legs more quickly, and when the music
played slowly his legs went slowly, too, the boys
pulling the strings that way.</p>

<p>“He will learn to dance in a little while,” said
the keeper.</p>

<p>For about an hour Dido had to lift first one
foot then the other as the strings were pulled and
the music played. Then he was allowed to rest
and given a lump of sugar.</p>

<p>“Oh! how good that is!” thought Dido. “It
is almost as nice as honey!”</p>

<p>The next day Dido practiced his dancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
again, with the strings on his legs. But this time
he did better. And, at the end of his lesson, he
was given more sugar. Soon Dido learned to
know that when the horn played and his keeper
cried “Dance!” that he must get up on his hind
legs and circle around, lifting first one foot and
then the other. And each time he danced Dido
was given a lump of sugar.</p>

<p>And, finally, one day the man did not put the
strings to Dido’s legs. He just led the little bear
out by the chain, and blew the horn.</p>

<p>“Dance, Dido! Dance!” cried the man, playing
jolly music.</p>

<p>And Dido danced, all by himself, and he liked
it, too, for the music seemed to make him happy.</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried the man, “my little bear has
learned to dance! Soon we will go traveling
over the world together.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>DIDO CROSSES THE OCEAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Every day, and sometimes two and three
times a day, Dido’s keeper would come
out to him with the horn, and make the
little bear dance. And sometimes Dido grew
tired. Then the man would give him a sweet
bun, or a lump of sugar, and Dido could rest in
the shade, or take a nice bath in the tub of water.</p>

<p>Dido was growing to like to dance, for it was
something like the tricks he and his brothers used
to do in the woods, though they never called it
dancing. They would find a loose, dangling
branch of a tree and stand up on their hind legs
to knock it about with their front paws. And
sometimes when the branch would sway to and
fro the bear cubs would have to jump quickly
about to reach it. And that, in a way, was something
like dancing.</p>

<p>So, after all, dancing is not so very hard for
a bear to learn. They seem to like it, and Dido
certainly liked the good things he had to eat
after each lesson. So now, whenever he heard
the man play a tune on the shiny brass horn, Dido
would stand up and dance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think it is time you learned other tricks,”
the man said one day. “I must teach you how
to climb a tree and how to stand on your head,
how to turn somersaults, and how to play soldier.
But you can not learn all of them at once. We
will begin on climbing a tree, for that will be
easy for you.”</p>

<p>Of course the man knew Dido could climb a
tree, as all bears can do that just as cats can.
Their claws are sharp, though not quite as sharp
as are pussies’, and they can stick in the soft bark
of a tree. Dogs’ claws are not sharp, so that is
why they can not climb trees.</p>

<p>“Come, Dido, go up in the tree,” said the
keeper one day, as he fastened a longer chain on
the bear’s collar. “Go up in the tree,” and he
led Dido to one.</p>

<p>But Dido did not climb up. He would have
done so if he had known what the man wanted,
but Dido did not know just what the words
meant. He saw the tree, and he knew he could
climb it, as he had often done in the woods at
home, but just then he did not feel like climbing
a tree. Perhaps he thought his chain was too
short, and he might get a pull that would make
him fall.</p>

<p>“Ah, I shall have to give you a little lesson,”
said the man. “Here, boy!” he called, and a boy
came with a big sweet bun, which he put on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
high branch of the tree, climbing up a ladder to
do it.</p>

<p>“Now, Dido, go get the bun! Go up in the
tree and get the bun,” called the man. Dido
could smell the bun, for he had a very sharp
nose. And he wanted the bun so much, the little
bear cub did, that he climbed right up the tree
and got it.</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried the man. “That’s the way to do
it! I knew you could climb a tree, but you must
do it when I tell you to, so as not to keep the
people waiting when we begin our travels, and
go all over the world. You will not find a bun
up a tree every time I ask you to climb it, Dido,”
said the bear’s keeper, “but I will always give
you a treat when you have finished your tricks.
Now come down, Dido!”</p>

<p>But Dido sat on the limb of the tree, eating
the bun. It tasted so good he did not want to
come down until he had finished it. Then he
felt a pull on the chain that was fast to his collar.</p>

<p>“Come down, Dido! Come down!” called
the man, and he pulled so hard on the chain that
Dido nearly fell. Then the bear knew what was
wanted of him, and down he climbed. But he
had eaten the bun.</p>

<p>“Now we must do it again,” the keeper said.
“Boy, put another bun up in the tree for Dido.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>So the boy did, and Dido climbed up and got
that bun. Each time the man played a tune on
the shiny brass horn, and it was a different tune
from the one he played for Dido to dance. And,
in a little while, Dido learned to climb up the
tree whenever he heard this tune, and when the
man told him to go up, whether there was a bun
in the tree or not.</p>

<p>You see Dido did not have to learn <em>how</em> to
climb a tree, for he knew that already. What
he had to learn was to do it <em>when</em> the man wanted
him to, and soon he did.</p>

<p>Dido could now do two tricks, if you call
climbing a tree a trick. Dancing, I think,
might really be called a trick for a bear, though
men and women, as well as boys and girls, dance
and do not think it a trick at all—that is, unless
they are learning some new, fancy steps.</p>

<p>“Dido, you are a good little bear,” said the
man, as the little cub came down out of the tree
after having climbed up. “I wonder if you will
learn to march like a soldier, and turn a somersault
as easily as you learned to dance and climb
a tree?”</p>

<p>Had the man only known it, Dido did not
have to be taught to turn somersaults, for the
little cub had often done this in the woods. But
what Dido did have to learn was to turn a somersault
when the man told him to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>It took a little longer for Dido to learn these
two new tricks—marching like a soldier, and
turning head over heels. But finally he did.
His keeper was good and kind, and gave him
nice things to eat, and Dido did his best to please
the man.</p>

<p>At last came the day when Dido could take a
stick in his paws, hold it straight up in the air,
or over his shoulder, as a soldier holds his gun,
and walk around while the man played a marching
tune on the shiny brass horn.</p>

<p>Then the little bear cub learned to turn somersaults,
or, rather, he learned to do it whenever
the man asked him to, and when the man played
a certain tune on the horn. But Dido could not
stand on his head. The man tried to get him to
do this, but Dido’s hind legs were so heavy that
whenever he stood on his head, with his front
feet down on the ground, he would fall over in a
heap.</p>

<p>“I guess we won’t try that trick,” the man said.
“It is too hard for you, Dido. We will make up
an easier one.”</p>

<p>Dido could now dance, turn somersaults,
march like a soldier, and climb a tree or a telegraph
pole. Only there were no telegraph poles
in the mountains, though soon Dido was to see
some.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Four tricks are quite a number for a little
bear cub to do, I think, even though some of
them were easy.</p>

<p>“We must now begin to think of traveling,”
said the man one day. “Yes, Dido, we will soon
start on our travel around the world, over to a
new country called the United States of America.
That is a new country for me, and it will
be a new one for you. The people over there
have lots of money, and they will give me pennies
when you do your tricks. With the pennies
I can buy things to eat for me and for you. Yes,
soon we shall sail over the ocean in a big ship
and go to America.”</p>

<p>Of course Dido did not know what all this
talk meant, but he saw his master smiling, and
the man seemed happy, so Dido was glad, for
the keeper was kind to him.</p>

<p>A few days after this Dido’s keeper gave him
a nice dinner of bread, fish and sweet buns.
Dido saw that the man had a big bundle strapped
over his back, while on one shoulder was the
shiny tooting horn. In one hand the man had
a long stick, with which Dido marched when he
did his shoulder trick.</p>

<p>“Come, Dido!” called the man, “we are now
going to start on our travels. We will march
through my country until we come to the ocean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and there we will take a ship. And on the way
you shall do your tricks, and the people will give
us money so we can buy things to eat.”</p>

<p>So Dido and his master started down the
mountain. At first the bear cub, who had
grown much larger, felt sad at going away from
the woods where he had always lived. He
could look back and see them and he knew the
blue lake was there, and perhaps his brothers and
father and mother were swimming in it.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wonder if I will ever see them again?”
thought Dido.</p>

<p>He never did, but then Dido had so many adventures,
and saw so many new and strange
sights, that he soon forgot all about his bear-folks.
That’s the way it is with wild animals,
you know. And I must tell you that Dido’s
father and mother, and his brothers Gruffo and
Muffo, tried very hard to find him.</p>

<p>They went looking for him that same day
Dido went off to search for the honey-tree. But
all Mr. Bear could find was the place where the
trap had been set, with the honey in it.</p>

<p>“I guess poor Dido is gone,” said Mr. Bear to
his wife.</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” cried Dido’s mother. “Do you
think a man will eat him?”</p>

<p>“Let us hope not,” said Mr. Bear. “Dido
was caught in a trap. Well, I told him to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
careful of them, but he did not mind. It is too
late now. Perhaps he is happier where he
is.”</p>

<p>And Dido was quite happy. His father and
mother, soon after that, had to find another den
to live in, because the animal trappers began
searching through the mountains for wild creatures,
and in a little while Dido was forgotten
by his folks, who had troubles of their own to
keep away from the hunters.</p>

<p>Down the mountain went Dido and his keeper.
Soon they came to a little town, or village. Dido
did not know what it was, but he saw many
houses, which were larger than the den he had
lived in among the rocks, and he saw many men,
like his kind keeper, and women and boys and
girls.</p>

<p>When Dido’s keeper led him through the village
streets the boys and girls crowded about to
see the bear.</p>

<p>“Now, Dido,” said the man, “you shall dance
for them.”</p>

<p>Then the man played a tooting tune on his
horn and Dido danced as he had been taught to
do. Around and around he went, first lifting
up one foot, then the other, the horn playing all
the while.</p>

<p>“Good, Dido! Good!” said the man.</p>

<p>The children clapped their hands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
laughed, and the older folks tossed money into
the hat of the keeper as he passed it around.</p>

<p>“Now march like a soldier!” said the man, and
Dido did. Then the bear climbed a tree, and
turned a somersault, and the children laughed
louder than before, and clapped their hands
harder.</p>

<p>“What a funny dancing bear!” cried a little
girl.</p>

<p>“I wish we had him for a pet,” said a little
boy.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha! I cannot give away my dancing
bear,” said the man. “He and I are going to a
far country.”</p>

<p>For many days Dido traveled with the man,
walking from town to town, sometimes to big
cities. At night the man would take a blanket
from the bundle on his back, roll himself up in
it and go to sleep under a haystack or a bush.
He would tie Dido to a tree, and the bear would
go to sleep, too. Only Dido did not have to
wrap himself up in a blanket, as he had a big,
thick warm overcoat of fur. This was in the
summer time, when it was not too cold for the
man to sleep out of doors.</p>

<p>With the money which the people tossed into
the hat after they had watched the dancing bear,
the man would buy things to eat for himself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
for Dido. And thus they traveled on and on
until finally they came to the seashore.</p>

<p>“Now we will take a ship and go across the
ocean,” said the man.</p>

<p>Dido did not know what the ocean was, but
he saw a lot of water, much more than was in the
blue mountain lake. But it was not the same
kind. For, when Dido lapped up some with his
red tongue, the water was salty.</p>

<p>“Wuff! I do not like that water!” said Dido to
himself.</p>

<p>Dido’s master led him through a long shed
and up on the ship. Of course Dido did not
know what a ship was, but soon he found himself
in a little room with his keeper and he knew it
was all right. So Dido went to sleep.</p>

<p>When he awakened he felt himself swaying
up and down as he had often swayed when in the
top of a tree.</p>

<p>“This is queer,” thought Dido. “I am not in
a tree, but I am going up and down. What
makes it?”</p>

<p>It was a ship, you see, tossing on the ocean
waves. In about a week Dido and his master
had crossed the ocean and were in America.
The ship reached the big city of New York, and
Dido was ready for many new adventures.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>DIDO IN THE COUNTRY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">New York is a big city, and it is not a
place where bears live, except in Central
Park, or Bronx Park, where there
are many wild animals in cages or dens. And it
was to New York that Dido had come with his
keeper.</p>

<p>On the ship Dido had had some adventures,
and I wish I had space enough in this book to tell
you about what happened to him. But I think,
perhaps, you would rather hear about Dido’s
adventures as he traveled about the country and
cities, dancing, turning somersaults, and climbing
trees and telegraph poles.</p>

<p>So I will just say that on the ship Dido did a
few tricks for the passengers on deck when the
weather was fine. When it was stormy Dido
and his keeper had to stay down in their room.
And Dido had all he wanted to eat.</p>

<p>For there were on that ship many children,
and when they heard that Dido, the dancing
bear, was also a passenger they gave him some of
their buns, apples and other good things. So
Dido had a happy time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Once there was a big storm, and the ship almost
turned a somersault, as Dido himself had
done in the woods. But the storm passed, the
sun came out, and the ocean grew quiet. Then
Dido felt better.</p>

<p>Now he was in New York with his keeper.
As I have told you, a big city is not a good place
for a bear to live. Of course there is enough for
him to eat, if he can get it, but there are not
many trees, except in the streets, and policemen
don’t like to see bears climbing the city trees.
And in a city there are no lakes of blue water,
in which bears may swim.</p>

<p>But Dido’s master took him to a stable where
there were many horses, and here Dido felt quite
at home, though at first the horses were frightened
when they smelled the bear. For horses
smell in much the same way as do bears. If you
have ever held out an apple, or a lump of sugar,
to a horse you have seen him smell it before he
tasted it. All animals do this. They can often
smell better than they can see, and they tell, in
that way, whether a thing is good for them to
eat. So when the horses smelled Dido, the
dancing bear, they were a bit frightened, as they
were not used to wild animals, and they thought
Dido was wild. But when they saw him do
some of his tricks, which he did for practice in
the barn, the horses were afraid no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“We will stay in this stable a little while,” said
Dido’s master to him, “and then we will go out
in the country, and people will give us money
when you dance.”</p>

<p>One day Dido’s keeper went out and stayed a
long time. When he came back he was very
happy.</p>

<p>“Ah, Dido!” cried the man, “we are going to
a circus. You are going to do some tricks there.
We shall have a good time, and I will get money
to buy buns for you. After the circus we will go
out in the nice country, where the trees grow as
they do on the mountain where I caught you.”</p>

<p>Dido did not know what a circus was, but he
soon found out.</p>

<p>In New York City is a place called Madison
Square Garden. It is a big building, and on
top of the tower, where the pigeons live, is a
statue of a golden lady, with a bow and arrow.
The lady is named Diana, and, many, many years
ago, she used to hunt wild animals in the woods
of her country. Perhaps that is why they have
the circus in Madison Square Garden.</p>

<p>A circus there is not like one in a tent. All
the animals and all the performers are in one big
building. The animals are mostly down in the
basement, as they call it.</p>

<p>And it was there that Dido was taken by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
keeper. The dancing bear rode in a big express
wagon, just as he had ridden down the mountain
after he had been caught in the trap-cage.
Only this time Dido was not afraid, as his kind
keeper was with him to pat him on the head and
give him sweet buns.</p>

<p>Dido was taken into Madison Square Garden,
and as soon as he got inside he smelled the smell
of many wild animals. He was not afraid, for
he was used to that smell. He could tell there
were other bears in the circus, and he saw them
in cages, but none of them were let go about as
was he.</p>

<p>And Dido saw camels, lions, tigers, monkeys,
ponies, horses, and many other animals.</p>

<p>Dido’s master led him down where the animals
were kept, and chained him to a post, with
some water near by for him to drink, and some
bread and buns to eat.</p>

<p>“I am going away for a little while, Dido,”
the man said. “But I will soon be back. Then
we will go up in the circus ring and you will do
your tricks for the boys and girls. Be a good
bear while I am away.”</p>

<p>Dido ate a bun, drank some water, and looked
about him. Over in one corner the dancing bear
saw a queer animal, who seemed to have two
tails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, but who are you?” asked
Dido, in the sort of talk that all animals understand.</p>

<p>“Who am I?” asked the big animal who
seemed to have two tails. “Why I am Tum
Tum, the jolly elephant.”</p>

<p>“Tum Tum, eh?” exclaimed Dido. “That is
a nice name, but you are a funny chap, with two
tails.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is where you make a mistake,” said
Tum Tum, as he chewed a mouthful of hay.
“I have only one tail. The other is my trunk
that I lift things with. It is really only a long
nose, for I breathe through it, but folks call it a
trunk.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see,” spoke Dido. “I am sorry I
thought you had two tails.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” went on jolly Tum Tum.
“Don thought the same thing when he first saw
me.”</p>

<p>“Don? Who is Don?” asked Dido.</p>

<p>“Don is a runaway dog. That is, he once ran
away,” explained the elephant, reaching for a
peanut which a boy held out to him. “But Don
is home now after his many adventures.”</p>

<p>“What are adventures?” asked Dido.</p>

<p>“Things that happen to you,” answered Tum
Tum. “I had many adventures, and so did Don.
A man wrote a book about each of us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is a book?” asked Dido.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t ask me,” said Tum Tum. “All I
know is that’s what they called it. A book is a
queer thing. It is square, like a loaf of bread,
but not so thick—at least the books about Don
and me were not so thick. And inside the book
are thin pieces of something they call pages, or
leaves, though they are not green like the leaves
of a tree. The leaves in the book are white and
on them are funny black marks. And when boys
and girls look at the funny black marks, which
tell about Don and me, they laugh, those boys
and girls do, for I have heard them say so when
they come here to the circus to see me.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if my adventures will ever be put in
a book?” asked Dido.</p>

<p>“Maybe so,” answered Tum Tum, the jolly
elephant. “Have you had many things happen
to you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, lots and lots!” cried the dancing bear.
“I used to live in the woods, and I went in a box
to get some honey and I found myself in a trap.”</p>

<p>“That was an adventure,” said Tum Tum, “so
I think you will be put in a book.”</p>

<p>Dido was very glad to meet the jolly elephant,
and the two talked together for some time. Then
Tum Tum had to go up in the circus ring to do
his tricks, and, a little later, Dido’s master came
for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come, Dido,” said the man. “You are going
to show the people what you can do. I want you
to dance, to turn somersaults, and to march like a
soldier.</p>

<p>“There are no trees for you to climb, but there
is a big post in the circus ring, and you can climb
that, I’m sure. I’ll give you a bun if you do.”</p>

<p>And Dido did climb the pole, and he did his
other tricks, so that the people in the circus, especially
the boys and girls, laughed and clapped
their hands to see <a href="#i_p065">Dido, the dancing bear, and
Tum Tum, the jolly elephant</a>.</p>

<p>Then one day Dido’s keeper said to him:</p>

<p>“Come, Dido, the circus is going to move
away from New York, so we will move, too.
Only we will go out in the country by ourselves,
and we will travel along so you can do your
tricks, and I can gather the pennies in my hat.”</p>

<p>The next day Dido and his keeper rode out in
the country in a railroad train. Dido slept in a
corner of a baggage car, where the trunks were.
He liked the train better than the ocean ship, for
it did not go up and down so much, though it
moved faster.</p>

<p>“Ah, here we are in the country!” cried Dido’s
keeper, as he led him out of the car.</p>

<p>“And now, I suppose,” thought Dido, “I will
have some more adventures, and they may be
put into a book, as Tum Tum’s were.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>DIDO MEETS DON</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dido, the dancing bear, looked about him
as he stepped down out of the railroad
car. The train had stopped at a small
country station, and when some men and boys,
who were waiting on the platform, saw the bear
they crowded up close to have a better look at
him.</p>

<p>“Say, he’s a big fellow!” said one boy, not
coming too close.</p>

<p>“Will he bite?” asked another.</p>

<p>“No, Dido is a good bear. He will not bite,”
the keeper answered. “He can do many tricks.”</p>

<p>Dido felt proud and happy when he heard
this, for he was now able to understand much
that his master said. And Dido was really
growing to be a big bear. He was not a little
bear cub any longer, but quite fat. For he had
good things to eat, and he did not have to travel
over the mountain to get them.</p>

<p>“Please make your bear do some tricks,” said
a man to the keeper, whose name, I have forgotten
to tell you, was George. “Make the bear do
some funny tricks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you give me pennies if I do?” George
asked. “I need the pennies to buy things for
Dido and me to eat.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead and have the bear do tricks, and
we’ll give you pennies,” another man said with
a smile.</p>

<p>So George, the dancing bear’s trainer, led
Dido back of the railroad station, where there
was a nice, shady, grassy spot. Dido looked all
around and he saw that they were indeed in the
country. There were only a few houses here
and there, and afar off he could see woods and
mountains, almost like those in his own land.
Dido sniffed the air. It was pure and sweet,
much nicer than the air in New York, or in any
city, Dido thought.</p>

<p>“I am going to like it in the country, I’m
sure,” said the bear to himself. “But I wish my
adventures would begin so they could be put in
a book. I wonder who will do it?”</p>

<p>Of course Dido had had some adventures,
though perhaps he did not know it, and he was
going to have more, and I have put them in this
book, though I don’t believe Dido knows me.
I have often seen him, however, and fed him
buns.</p>

<p>“Come now, Dido, get ready to do some
tricks!” called George. “You are going to
dance for the people. Dance nice now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the man played a tooting tune on his
brass horn.</p>

<p>“Toodle-de-doodle-de-do!” played the man,
and when Dido heard that music he knew it was
the kind to which he danced. So he stood up
on his hind legs, held his fore paws limply out in
front of him, and began to lift first one foot and
then the other, going around and around, just
like a person waltzing.</p>

<p>“That’s it, Dido! That’s the way to do it!”
cried his keeper. “Dance for the people!” And
he played a faster tune on the brass horn, so that
Dido got quite dizzy from going around so fast.
But the man did not make him do this very long.</p>

<p>“Good! Good!” cried the people who stood
in a ring around Dido as he danced. “That was
fine!”</p>

<p>“Did you like it?” asked George. “I am
glad, and Dido is glad, too; aren’t you, Dido?”
and reaching in the bag which he carried over
his shoulder the man gave Dido a sweet bun.</p>

<p>Dido was glad to get that, whether or not he
was glad to dance. But I think he liked dancing,
too, for bears seem to be fond of going about
doing their little tricks.</p>

<p>“Can your bear do anything else?” asked a
lady in the crowd.</p>

<p>“Many more things,” answered George. “He
will now play he is a soldier. Hi, Dido!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
March like a soldier! Here is your gun!” and
he tossed Dido the stick which was carried along,
just to be used in this trick.</p>

<p>Dido stood up as straight as he could, and held
the stick in his paw, up over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Good, Dido!” cried George. “Now what
do you do when you meet an officer?”</p>

<p>Dido raised his other paw and touched his
head, making what is called a salute, which soldiers
always give their officers when they meet.</p>

<p>“Now march, Dido!” cried George, and as he
played a marching tune on the brass horn Dido
marched around, carrying the stick for a gun.</p>

<p>The people clapped their hands at that, and
when the keeper passed around his hat many
cents and some dimes jingled into it, to buy more
buns for Dido, and other things for the keeper
to eat.</p>

<p>“Make him do some more tricks, please,”
begged a boy in the crowd. “I have another
penny.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Very good!” cried George. “Dido,
shall we do some more tricks for the little boy
who has a penny?” Then George made believe
whisper that question in Dido’s ear, and next the
man pretended to put his ear down to Dido’s
mouth as if to listen for an answer.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dido says he will do another trick for
you,” said the man, laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course Dido did not really speak to his
trainer, for though a bear, a dog or other animals
can understand much that is said to them
they can not answer back. But the man just pretended
Dido did answer so as to make a little fun,
and the people laughed.</p>

<p>“Now, Dido, do your somersault trick,” said
George. “All ready!”</p>

<p>He blew a sharp blast on the horn, and Dido
leaned down, put his head on the ground, kicked
his hind legs up in the air, and over he went,
turning a somersault just as some fat little boy
might do it on the soft, green grass.</p>

<p>“Another, Dido! Turn another somersault!”
cried George, and over went Dido again, while
the people laughed. Then Dido stood up
straight once more, and saluted like a soldier.</p>

<p>“Did you like that trick, little boy?” asked
George.</p>

<p>“Very much,” the little boy answered. “And
here is my penny,” and he tossed it into the man’s
hat.</p>

<p>“Now for a last trick, and then we will travel
on farther into the country,” said Dido’s master.
“Do the tree-climbing trick, Dido. Only instead
of a tree you will climb a telegraph pole.”</p>

<p>There was a pole near the railroad depot, and
soon Dido was going up this, sticking his sharp
claws in the wood. Up and up he went, nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to the top, as far as his chain would let him, the
man holding the end of it.</p>

<p>“That’s far enough—come on down, Dido!”
called the man, and Dido came down. He was
given another bun to eat, and after this he drank
some water from a fountain near the depot.</p>

<p>Dido and George traveled on into the green
country. A few boys followed them a little way,
for some of them had never seen a bear before.
But soon the boys grew tired, and Dido and his
master were left to themselves.</p>

<p>“We will go to a quiet place in the woods and
sleep,” said George, and Dido was glad of this,
for he wanted to cool off and get quiet after his
ride in the train and doing his tricks.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, when they had had a good
sleep, the dancing bear and his keeper traveled
on again. Soon they came to another town, and
there Dido did his tricks over once more, and
the man gathered money in his hat. And here
Dido’s master met a man from his own country,
far over the sea. The two men were glad to see
one another, and talked much in their own language.</p>

<p>“Will you not come along with Dido and me?”
asked George of this man, whose name was Tom.
“We can travel together, and you can blow the
horn while I make Dido do tricks. Come,
travel about the country with us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I will do that,” Tom said, and so all
three started off together. Dido liked Tom very
much, for Tom gave the dancing bear some
sweet popcorn balls, of which Dido was very
fond.</p>

<p>For a week or more Dido traveled about with
George and Tom, doing tricks, sometimes in little
country towns, and again in cities. And one
day, when they were out in the country, Dido
had a little adventure.</p>

<p>They were marching along the road, when
Dido saw, coming toward them an automobile,
with a man on the front seat steering, while in
back were a boy and a girl, and two dogs.</p>

<p>All at once there was a loud banging noise,
like a gun. But it was not a gun. One of the
automobile tires had burst. Then the man
jumped out to fix a new tire on the wheels, and
the boy and girl, with the two dogs, got out to
rest in the shade.</p>

<p>Tom blew a little music on the horn, and this
made the boy and girl look down the road.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” cried the girl, whose name was
Alice. “What is that? A bear! I’m afraid!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said the boy, whose name
was Bob. “It is only a tame, trained bear.”</p>

<p>The two dogs barked at the bear, and then
Dido, who, with the two men, had come closer to
the automobile, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid of me, doggies. I won’t hurt
any one. I am only going to do some tricks.”</p>

<p>“Can your bear do tricks?” asked the boy of
George.</p>

<p>“He surely can,” answered Dido’s keeper, and
Dido turned somersaults, marched around like a
soldier, and climbed a telegraph pole.</p>

<p>“It certainly is a good trick,” said one dog.
“I can do some myself, but I can’t climb telegraph
poles. What is your name, dancing
bear?” he asked.</p>

<p>“My name is Dido. What’s yours?”</p>

<p>“My name is Don,” said the dog, “and this is
my friend Rex,” and he waved his tail at the
other dog.</p>

<p>“What! Is your name Don?” cried Dido in
surprise. “Why I have heard about you!”</p>

<p>“Who from?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“From Tum Tum.”</p>

<p>“What! That jolly elephant in the circus?”
asked Don, himself quite excited now.</p>

<p>“That’s the one,” answered Dido. “I was in
the circus a little while when it showed in Madison
Square Garden, in New York, and there I
met Tum Tum. He spoke about you, and said
you had had many adventures.”</p>

<p>“So I have,” Don said. “I am a runaway dog,
that is, I once was, and there is a book telling all
about me,” he added, proudly.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>DIDO HELPS A GIRL</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“See how friendly our dogs are with the
dancing bear,” said Alice, the girl, to
Bob, the boy.</p>

<p>“Our bear is very good and tame, and he likes
good dogs,” spoke George.</p>

<p>“Where did you get him?” asked the boy, for
the automobile tire was not yet fixed, and they
still had to wait beside the country road.</p>

<p>“I caught Dido on top of a mountain, in the
woods, in a far country,” said the man. “I put
some honey in a box and when he went in to get
it the door fell shut and he could not get out.
Then I trained him, and brought him to this
country. He was a little fellow then, and he
used to growl at me, but now he likes me, I think,
for I try to be kind to him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do like you,” said Dido to himself.
“He is good to me,” he added, speaking to the
two dogs.</p>

<p>For though Dido, Don and Rex could understand
most of the talk that went on, they themselves
could not speak to the men, or to the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
or girl. Then the man told the boy and girl how
Dido had learned to dance, just as I have told
you in the first part of this book.</p>

<p>“Did it all happen that way?” asked Don, of
Dido, for the dogs and bear were resting in the
shade now.</p>

<p>“That’s just the way it happened,” Dido said.
“I lived in the woods with my father and mother,
and my brothers Gruffo and Muffo. But I like
it here now better than in the woods.”</p>

<p>“And how is Tum Tum, the jolly elephant?”
asked Don.</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered Dido, “and as fond of
peanuts as ever.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he always did like them,” barked Don,
“but, as for me, I never could see much in them.
The shells get in my teeth.”</p>

<p>“Tum Tum eats them, shells and all,” Dido
said.</p>

<p>“Well, remember me to him when next you
see him,” went on the dog who had once run
away. “Tell him I would like to see him
again.”</p>

<p>“I shall,” Dido promised, “though I don’t
know when I may meet him again. He is in the
circus, you know, and I am traveling about the
country. Still I may see him.”</p>

<p>By this time the automobile tire was mended
and the man called to the boy and girl to get in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“That means we shall have to go also,” said
Don. “Well, good-by, Dido. I am glad to
have met you.”</p>

<p>“And so am I,” said Rex, the other dog. Then
they rubbed noses together, which is a sort of
way animals have of shaking hands, I suppose;
and then they parted.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to tell Tum Tum what I told
you!” barked Don, with a wag of his tail, as he
jumped up with the boy and girl.</p>

<p>“I’ll not,” promised Dido, waving his paw at
the two dogs.</p>

<p>Then the automobile puffed away and Tom
and George led Dido down the country road,
now and then stopping in front of a house to
blow a tune on the brass horn, so Dido could do
his tricks.</p>

<p>That night it rained, so the two men with the
dancing bear could not sleep out in the woods.
They looked around until they found a barn, and
they asked the farmer if they might sleep in
that.</p>

<p>“If you will kindly let us,” said George, “we
will make our bear do tricks for you, and you
will not need to give us any money in the hat.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” the farmer said; “you and Dido
may sleep on the hay in my barn. And I will
give you something to eat, though I do not know
what bears like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“He likes buns especially,” said George, “and
I have none for him in my bag. He ate the last
one this noon, and since then we have not come
to a bakery where I could buy more.”</p>

<p>“Likes buns, does he?” asked the farmer’s
wife. “Well, I have some, but they have raisins
in. Do you think Dido would not like them on
that account?”</p>

<p>“Raisins in the buns!” cried George, making
a low bow. “Why he will like them all the better
on that account. The buns I give him only
have little currants in. He will like raisins very
much better indeed.”</p>

<p>And Dido did. He thought he had never
tasted such good buns as those the farmer’s wife
gave him. And Dido did all his tricks in the
barn that night, safe and dry from the rain. The
farmer and his wife, the hired man and some
boys and girls, came from nearby houses to watch
Dido do his tricks, and no one had to give a cent
because the farmer had been kind to the men,
and the farmer’s nice wife had been very good
to Dido.</p>

<p>The next morning the sun shone, for the rain
had stopped, and after Dido had taken a bath,
in the big trough where the farm horses drank,
he and his two masters started off down the country
road again, having had a good breakfast.</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife gave George more raisin-buns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to put in his bag for Dido, and the dancing
bear was very glad when he saw them.</p>

<p>“I shall not be hungry to-day,” said Dido to
himself.</p>

<p>That day they passed through two or three
small towns, and Dido did his tricks several
times, so that the hat of George had quite some
money in it. And that night the men and their
trained bear slept in the woods, with moss for a
bed and the blankets they carried with them for
covers. Dido’s fur was <em>his</em> blanket.</p>

<p>Dido awakened early the next morning, before
either of the men. He looked at them
sleeping near him, and then he rolled over on
the bed of moss, stretched his strong legs,
scratched with his claws on the soft ground and
opened his mouth to stretch that in a big yawn.</p>

<p>Then Dido stood up, and he saw that during
the night the chain, which George always used
to fasten him to a tree, had come loose.</p>

<p>“Why, I could run away if I wanted to,”
thought Dido. “I could slip off in the woods
and run away, as Don, the dog, did. Only I
won’t. George would feel badly, and, besides,
I might not be able to get anything to eat. These
woods may not be like the woods on the mountain
where I used to live. I guess I will not
run away. I will just walk down to that little
brook and get a drink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Not far from where the men and bear had
slept that night was a nice brook, bubbling over
green, mossy stones. Dido went down to the
bank of it, and, as he was getting a drink, he saw
some fish swimming about.</p>

<p>“Ha! Fish!” said Dido to himself. “That’s
good. Here is my breakfast all ready and waiting
for me—if I can catch one.”</p>

<p>The dancing bear leaned over the water as his
father and mother had taught him to do. He
had not forgotten. Dido waited. Pretty soon
he saw, swimming along, a big, shiny fish.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha!” thought Dido. “I guess I can get
you!”</p>

<p>Down he scooped with his paw, getting his
claws under the fish, and out of the water he
lifted him.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” cried Tom, awakening just in time
to see Dido toss the fish out on the bank. “What
is our bear doing?”</p>

<p>“He is getting his breakfast,” answered
George. “Wild bears often catch fish that way.
But this is the first time I ever saw Dido do it.
I wish he would catch some for us.”</p>

<p>And Dido did, though he did not know he was
catching fish for his masters. He thought they
would all be for him. But Dido pulled out of
the brook more fish than he really needed, and
Tom and George built a fire and cooked some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
for themselves. Dido did not bother about a
fire. He was afraid of a blaze, as all animals
are.</p>

<p>After their breakfast in the woods, Dido and
his masters marched on again. Whenever they
came to a village Tom would blow on the brass
horn, and Dido would dance around, turn somersaults,
march like a soldier and climb a tree
or telegraph pole. The people liked to see this
last more than anything else, and Dido liked to
climb, for he was used to that. He really liked
it better than turning somersaults, for much dust
got in his thick fur when he got down and rolled
over on the ground.</p>

<p>Dido was a clean bear, and whenever he became
dusty and dirty he wanted a bath. And
whenever they came to a lake or stream of water
Dido was allowed to go in, and splash about as
much as he pleased.</p>

<p>One hot afternoon Dido was asleep in the
woods with the two men. They had performed
the tricks in one village, and were going on to
another, taking a rest in between.</p>

<p>Once again Dido awakened to find his two
masters asleep, but this time the chain was still
fast to a tree, so Dido could not wander very
far. He got up and walked about, and, as he
did so he heard, off through the woods, the barking
of a dog, and then a scream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>All at once Dido saw a girl running along the
path in the woods, and behind the girl came a
big black dog, barking angrily, and trying to
catch the girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, stop him! Somebody please stop him!”
screamed the girl. “He is a bad dog and wants
to bite me!”</p>

<p>Of course Dido did not know all the girl said,
but he could see that the dog was angry and had
sharp teeth. He might bite the girl, though
why any dog should want to bite such a nice girl
Dido could not tell.</p>

<p>“Don’t let him get me!” begged the girl, and
she ran toward Dido and the two men, who were
now awake.</p>

<p>“Here!” cried Dido to the bad dog in animal
language. “You let that girl alone!”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll not!” barked the dog. “I am going
to bite her!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you’re not!” said Dido, and he
growled now, for he did not like this kind of a
dog. Then, <a href="#i_p081">just as the dog was going to jump</a>
at the girl, <a href="#i_p081">Dido stepped in between them</a>, and,
with one sweep of his big paw, the dancing bear
knocked the dog to one side, so that he rolled
over and over in the leaves.</p>

<p>“There! Now I guess you’ll let little girls
alone!” said Dido, standing ready to knock the
dog away again if he sprang at the girl.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>DIDO IN THE BAKERY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Don’t be afraid, little girl, we won’t
let the bad dog hurt you,” said the
man named George. “Whose dog is
he?”</p>

<p>“He—he belongs to a tin peddler,” said the
little girl. “I was walking along the road just
now and a boy, behind me, threw a stone at the
dog. I guess the dog must have thought I threw
it, for he chased after me, and I ran, for I was
afraid he would bite me.”</p>

<p>“I guess he would have, if he had caught you,”
remarked Tom. “But Dido knocked him out of
the way.”</p>

<p>“Is Dido the name of your bear?” asked the
girl.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered George. “Dido is our bear.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty name,” said the little girl.</p>

<p>Dido, who was watching to see if the dog
would get up and run at the little girl again,
wondered what her name was.</p>

<p>“So she likes my name,” said Dido to himself.
“I wonder if she likes me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The bad dog got up from the pile of leaves
where Dido had knocked him. He growled,
deep down in his throat, and Dido called:</p>

<p>“Be careful! Don’t try any of your bad
tricks around here. Are you going to bite this
little girl?”</p>

<p>“No, I am not,” said the dog. “I guess I made
a mistake. I thought she threw a stone at me,
but perhaps she did not.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t look like a girl who would throw
stones at a dog or a bear,” Dido said. “You had
better let her alone and go back where you belong.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said the dog, limping as he went
away. “I am sorry I chased after her.”</p>

<p>“And I am sorry I had to hit you so hard with
my paw,” spoke the dancing bear. “But it was
the only way to stop you from jumping on the
little girl.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so. You made me a little
lame, but I guess that could not be helped. It
was my own fault, but I surely thought she threw
a stone at me. Good-by, Mr. Bear.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Mr. Dog,” answered Dido. “Next
time we meet we shall be friends.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” spoke the dog, limping away.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad he is gone!” the little girl
said. “I was afraid of him.”</p>

<p>“Where do you live?” asked Tom, for of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
course the little girl could not talk to the bear.</p>

<p>“Just down the road, but I have to go past that
dog to get to my house,” she answered. “I am
afraid.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. We’ll walk with you,” said
George, “and then the dog won’t come near
you.”</p>

<p>Of course neither the men nor the little girl
knew that the peddler’s dog had promised to be
good. They had seen Dido and the dog close
together, but they did not know of what they
were talking.</p>

<p>“You are not afraid of our bear, are you?”
asked Tom, as he picked up the brass horn from
where it had fallen in the moss as he slept.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I’m not a bit afraid of him,” answered
the little girl, looking at Dido. “He
seems a nice, gentle bear.”</p>

<p>“He is,” said George. “Would you like to
see him do some tricks?”</p>

<p>“Oh, very much!” cried the little girl, clapping
her hands. “Will he do some tricks for
me?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” answered George with a laugh.
“Do some tricks for the little girl you saved from
the dog, Dido. Play a tune, Tom!”</p>

<p>So Tom played a tune on the brass horn, and
Dido danced there in the woods, with only the
little girl for an audience. But Dido did his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
best, even though there was only one person to
look on, besides Tom and George.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a funny trick!” laughed the little
girl, whose name was Rose, as she saw Dido turn
a somersault. Dido did not mind turning head
over heels in the woods, for he could do it on the
soft green moss, and his fur did not get full of
dust.</p>

<p>“Now we will walk down the road to your
home,” said George to the little girl. “Then
you will not be afraid of the dog.”</p>

<p>But when they went out in the country road
the peddler’s wagon was gone, and the dog was
not in sight.</p>

<p>“There’s my house,” said the little girl, pointing
to a white one down the highway.</p>

<p>Just then a woman came to the door of the
house, and, looking down the road, she saw her
little girl walking with two men and a bear.</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness, Rose! What are you
doing?” cried the woman, who was the mother
of Rose. “Where have you been? And what
is that terrible bear doing?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t a terrible bear at all, Mamma,” answered
Rose, laughing. “He is a good trick
bear, and he saved me from the bad dog.” And
she told about what had happened.</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s a tame, trick bear, why I suppose
that is different,” said the woman. “I’m much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
obliged to you,” she added to the men, “for having
your bear save my little girl from the peddler’s
dog.”</p>

<p>“Dido did it all himself,” said George. “We
were asleep when your Rose came running along
with the dog after her. Dido knocked him out
of the way.”</p>

<p>“He must be a good bear,” said Rose’s mother.</p>

<p>“He is!” cried the little girl. “You ought to
see him do tricks, Mamma! Will you let your
bear do some tricks for my mother?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Surely,” answered George. “Come on now,
Dido!”</p>

<p>So Dido did most of his tricks again, and
when they were finished the woman brought out
some sugar cookies and other things, giving some
to the men and some to Dido.</p>

<p>“Oh, how good they are!” thought the dancing
bear, chewing a cookie. “They are as good as
the buns with raisins in which the other lady
gave me.”</p>

<p>“Come, now, we must travel on,” called
George to Dido, after a bit. “It is very nice
here, but we must go to a place where we can
get money in the hat when you do your tricks.”</p>

<p>So off started the two men with the dancing
bear once more. For several days they traveled,
first stopping in one country village and then in
another, Dido doing his tricks very nicely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Then for two days it rained, and as no one
wanted to stand out in the rain to see even a
dancing bear there was nothing to do save to
stay in barns, or under sheds, until the weather
cleared.</p>

<p>For George and Tom did not stop at hotels
very often as they traveled about with Dido. In
the first place it cost too much money, and as
the weather was warm, and as George and Tom
were sort of Gypsies they liked to sleep out of
doors nights, except when it rained. Then they
would find a haystack, or a barn, and get shelter.</p>

<p>Another reason they did not stop at hotels was
because people who kept them did not like bears
in their places. Dido would have had to stay
out in the stable, and some horses are afraid of
bears.</p>

<p>So it was not so nice for the men when it
rained, though Dido did not mind. His fur was
so thick that it took a lot of rain to wet him
through, and he was fond of water anyhow.</p>

<p>But when it rained, and there was no one to
watch Dido do his tricks, of course no money
came into the hat, and when there were no pennies
there was not so much to eat. So you see,
after all, rain is not any too good for a dancing
bear.</p>

<p>But after a while the clouds rolled away, the
sun came out and Dido and his masters were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
glad. Once more they started off down the
country roads, Tom tooting on the horn and
George putting Dido through his tricks.</p>

<p>One day after Dido had done his dance in the
streets of a small city his two masters saw another
man, like themselves. This man had a
hand-organ and a monkey, and he went about
making music while the monkey collected pennies
in his red hat. Tom and George stopped
for a minute to talk to the hand-organ man,
whom they had known years before.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” asked Dido of the
monkey, when they found their masters paying
no attention to them.</p>

<p>“Jacko,” answered the monkey. “What’s
yours?”</p>

<p>“Dido; and I can dance. Can you?”</p>

<p>“No, but I can gather pennies in my hat. Can
you do that?”</p>

<p>Dido said he could not. He did not have a
hat, anyhow. The bear and monkey talked together,
just as their masters were doing, but in a
different way of course. Then Jacko said:</p>

<p>“I have a cousin, a monkey named Mappo.
Did you ever see him?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Dido, “but I have met Don,
the runaway dog, and Tum Tum, the jolly elephant.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mappo, my cousin, knows them!” cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Jacko. “I have often heard him speak of them.
Mappo is such a merry monkey. He had many
adventures, and they have all been put in a
book.”</p>

<p>“My! It seems every one is getting in books,”
said Dido. “I hope to have one written about
me. But say! I’m hungry, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” answered Jacko.</p>

<p>“My master always feeds me buns after I finish
my tricks,” went on the dancing bear, “but I
guess he is so busy talking now that he has forgotten
it.”</p>

<p>“I wish we could get something to eat,” spoke
Jacko. “Oh, look, Dido, there’s a bakery store
over there, and I see buns and cake in the window,
besides cookies.”</p>

<p>“So there are!” said Dido.</p>

<p>“Let’s go over and see if they will give us
any,” went on the monkey who was a cousin to
Mappo. “My chain is loose, and I can easily
run over there.”</p>

<p>“My chain is loose, too,” said Dido. “Come
on, we’ll go over to the bakery and perhaps we
can find some buns.”</p>

<p>Across the street went Dido and Jacko. Their
masters were so busy talking about their travels
that they did not notice the two animals. And,
as it happened, the boy who had been left in
charge of the bakery had gone out to watch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
dancing bear, and he was now standing looking
at the hand-organ, and wishing he had one like
it. So he did not see Dido and the monkey go
in the bakery.</p>

<p>The dancing bear and the monkey went in the
bakery. No one else was there. In the window
was a pile of cakes and buns.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so hungry!” said Dido.</p>

<p>“So am I!” cried Jacko.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what let’s do,” said Dido. “Let’s
take some buns, and when our masters get
through talking they will come in and pay for
them.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jacko, and he reached over
in the bakery window and took a paw full of
buns. Dido did the same thing, and then the
bear and the monkey began to eat.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>DIDO SCARES A MAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Aren’t these buns fine?” asked Dido,
as he reached for another, which
had a big raisin on the top, something
like the kind the farmer’s wife made.</p>

<p>“They are very good,” said Jacko, the hand-organ
monkey. “I don’t know when I have had
better buns. I’m glad we came in here.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” replied Dido. “Have you tried
one of these sugar cookies?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Jacko, “I haven’t. I’ve been
so busy eating buns—”</p>

<p>“Oh, do try a cookie,” and the dancing bear,
with his big paw, like a hand, held something
out to the monkey.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they good?” asked Dido, after Jacko
had taken a taste of the cookie.</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes. I’ll have another.”</p>

<p>So the bear and the monkey ate cookies and
buns, and then Jacko found a little cake, with
sugar on the top.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dido!” he chattered. “These cakes are
the best yet. Try one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>So Dido did, and he liked it very much.</p>

<p>By this time the crowd of persons who had
gathered about to watch the dancing bear and
the monkey saw the two animals over in the
bakery. But the three men—that is, the two
who owned the dancing bear, and the one who
had the hand-organ—were still so busy talking
that they did not notice what was going on.</p>

<p>“Oh, look! The bear and monkey are eating
everything in the bakery!” cried a little girl.
The boy who had been left in charge of the shop
heard this and back across the street he rushed.
He did not wish for a hand-organ any more.</p>

<p>The people stood in a crowd outside the
bakery. The boy who should have been in the
shop, but who had run out, cried:</p>

<p>“Let me get in there! Let me in! I must
drive out that bear and monkey, or the baker
will say it is my fault for letting them in!”</p>

<p>“You’d better not go in,” said a man. “The
monkey would not hurt you, but the bear might.
Call the bear’s keepers.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the best thing to do,” said a
woman.</p>

<p>But before the boy could do this <a href="#i_p095">Jacko and
Dido were eating more cakes from the windows</a>.
Then they found some pies, and they liked those
so much they ate three, Dido taking two because
he was largest, and needed more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are all the people watching us for?”
asked Jacko, as he looked to see what next he
would take.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess they think we are doing tricks,”
said Dido. “But we are only eating because we
are hungry.”</p>

<p>“And when our masters get through talking
they will pay for what we have had,” said Jacko.</p>

<p>Just then the baker, who had been down in the
cellar of his shop, making bread and cake, came
up into the store, thinking, of course, that the
boy he had left in charge, to wait on customers,
would be there. Instead of that the baker saw
the bear and monkey eating things from his show
window.</p>

<p>“Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my!” cried the
baker, three times, just like that, he was so surprised.
“Oh! Oh! Oh!”</p>

<p>Then he ran back down in the cellar and
locked the door after him. But he need not
have been afraid, for neither Dido nor Jacko
would have harmed him in the least.</p>

<p>By this time George, Tom and the hand-organ
man saw what was happening. They looked
across the street and saw the crowd in front of
the bakery, and also saw Dido and Jacko still
eating cake.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” cried George. “We shall have to
pay a lot of money for what our bear has eaten.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<div id="i_p095" class="figcenter" style="width: 388px;">

<br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_93">Jacko and Dido were eating cakes from the window.</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I will have to pay for what my monkey
took,” said the hand-organ man.</p>

<p>“But they knew no better,” said George,
kindly. “They were hungry, I guess. But now
they must have had enough.”</p>

<p>And Dido and Jacko did have enough. Never
before had they had such a fine feast. I forget
just how much money the bear men and the
hand-organ man had to pay, but it was quite a
sum, for the monkey and bear had eaten many
buns, pies, cookies and cakes. A bear is very
big, and when he is hungry he can eat much.</p>

<p>“You will have to do a lot of dancing and
tricks to make up for all the bakery things you
took,” said George to Dido. But the bear did
not mind that, for he had had so many good
things to eat.</p>

<p>For two or three days more Dido traveled on
with his masters, going from place to place, in
towns and little villages where the bear did his
tricks.</p>

<p>And the people, especially the boys and girls,
liked them so much that they tossed many cents
and dimes into the hat of George, so that he had
enough to buy things for himself, for Tom and
for Dido, and the bear did not have to go in any
more bake shops all by himself.</p>

<p>Sometimes when Dido was doing his tricks,
dogs would gather outside the crowd of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
watching, and would bark. For the dogs were
a bit afraid of the bear, and did not like him.
That is why they barked.</p>

<p>Once a dog who did not know that Dido was
tame, and was kind and good, tried to bite the
dancing bear.</p>

<p>Dido was now so large and strong that he
might easily have hurt the dog badly by one
blow of his big paw. But instead of doing that
Dido just gently pushed the dog out of the way,
and over into a watering trough, where horses
drank.</p>

<p>When the people saw this they laughed, and
then that dog did not feel much like biting Dido.
The dog was ashamed of himself, and away he
ran, with his tail tucked between his legs.</p>

<p>“Good bear!” said George. “That’s the way
to treat barking dogs.”</p>

<p>Another time in a small town, where Dido was
doing his tricks in the park, a team of horses were
driven past. They smelled the wild smell of the
bear, which was more plain to them than to the
people, and started to run away.</p>

<p>A lady and little girl were in the carriage and
they might have been hurt had the horses gone
far. But Tom, who was getting ready to blow
a marching tune on the brass horn, for Dido to
do his trick, dropped the horn and sprang for the
horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>He caught them by the bridles and held them
so they could not run, and the lady and little girl
were not hurt.</p>

<p>“You are a good man to stop the runaway
horses,” said a man in the crowd.</p>

<p>“Well, it was the fault of our bear that the
team started to run,” said Tom, “so I knew it
was my place to stop them.”</p>

<p>And when the horses saw that Dido was not
going to chase after them, or do them any harm,
they were not frightened any more, but stood
still, so the lady and little girl in the carriage
could watch the tricks which Dido did.</p>

<p>That night Dido and his masters slept under
a warm stack of hay in a field, and a farmer gave
them some good things to eat, because he liked
animals. Dido did some tricks that evening in
front of the farmhouse, before a crowd of boys
and girls.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Dido awoke in his
warm nest in the hay. He was not tied to any
tree now, for there was none in the field, and he
could wander about as he pleased. But by this
time Dido was so tame that his masters knew he
would not run away.</p>

<p>“I think I will take a walk before breakfast,”
said Dido to himself, “and see if I cannot find a
brook with fish in. I should like a fish very
much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Dido saw a telegraph pole beside the
road near the field.</p>

<p>“I think I will climb that pole, and see how
sharp my claws are,” said Dido to himself. “I
must keep in practice and I have not climbed
any poles in two or three days.”</p>

<p>So, having eaten all the red berries he wanted,
Dido started to climb up the telegraph pole.
He had not gone very far up it before he heard
some one shouting at him. Looking up Dido
saw a man on top of the pole.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Dido to himself; “I did not
know men could climb poles like a bear. I wonder
who you are and how you did it?”</p>

<p>The man worked for a telephone company,
and on his boots he had sharp, iron spurs, like
a bear’s claws, and by sticking these spurs in the
wood of the pole the man could climb up.</p>

<p>But the man, who was out early fixing broken
wires on the pole, looking down and seeing a
bear coming up after him, was much frightened.</p>

<p>“I say!” he cried. “Go on back! Don’t come
up here after me! Go on down! Get away!”</p>

<p>The man shouted loudly, but Dido did not understand
why he, himself, should stop climbing
a pole on that account, so on he kept going up
higher and higher.</p>

<p>“Go back! Go back!” yelled the man. But
Dido would not.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>DIDO IN THE CIRCUS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“What in the world is the matter with
that man?” thought Dido, as the
dancing bear kept on climbing up
the pole. “He acts so funny, just as if he did
not want me to come near him. My master does
not act so. For, though I know I used to be
cross and growl at my master, and though I was
afraid of all men, I am not that way any more.
I like men. He looks like a nice man, up on
the pole, and I want to see him. I never before
saw a man who could climb a telegraph pole as
well as I can.”</p>

<p>So Dido kept on climbing up, and the man
continued to yell and shout. He went as far
up the pole as he could get, and sat down on a
stick of wood that stuck out crossways. There
were wires made fast to glass knobs on the ends
of these pieces of wood.</p>

<p>“He certainly is a queer man,” thought Dido.
“He acts just as if he didn’t like me. Well, I’ll
soon show him that I won’t hurt him. I wonder
if he has a bun in his pocket?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, Dido saw the man throw
something down.</p>

<p>“Ah! Perhaps that is a bun,” thought Dido.</p>

<p>But Dido felt the thing the man had thrown
down hit him hard on his nose, and it hurt so
that the dancing bear gave a growl and a howl.
It was a hard screwdriver that had hit Dido on
the nose. The telephone lineman had thrown
his screwdriver at the bear.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” said Dido to himself. “That was not
nice! I wonder if he did that on purpose?”</p>

<p>Dido stopped climbing for a moment, and
looked up at the man. Then the dancing bear
rubbed his nose with his paw. A bear’s nose is
very soft and tender, and when he is hit there it
hurts him very much.</p>

<p>Then, as Dido was rubbing his sore nose, all
of a sudden, Bang! something else was thrown
by the man. It was a pair of pliers, for cutting
wire, and they hit Dido on the paw he was holding
up.</p>

<p>“Ha!” thought the dancing bear. “It is a
good thing I had my paw over my nose, or I
would be hurt worse than ever. I wonder why
that man is throwing things at me, and shouting
so?”</p>

<p>Just then Tom and George, the keepers of the
bear, came running out of the field where they
had been asleep under the haystack. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
awakened, missed Dido, and had come to search
for him.</p>

<p>“Why, look at our bear!” cried George. “He
is up the pole.”</p>

<p>“So he is!” exclaimed Tom, in surprise.</p>

<p>Then the telephone lineman on the pole saw
the other two men.</p>

<p>“Hi, there!” he called to them. “Is this your
bear?”</p>

<p>“Surely that is our bear,” answered George.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I wish you’d call him down!”
went on the lineman. “He chased up here after
me to bite and scratch me. Call him down.”</p>

<p>“Ha! No!” laughed George. “Dido would
never climb up to bite or scratch you. He is
too good a bear for that. He is just climbing
the pole, as that is one of his tricks.”</p>

<p>“What! Is this a trick bear? Is he tame?”
asked the man high up on the pole.</p>

<p>“Of course he is tame,” said George.</p>

<p>“And he won’t hurt me?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. He just wants to be friends with
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then I am very sorry,” said the lineman
quickly.</p>

<p>“Sorry for what?” asked Tom, curiously.</p>

<p>“That I threw my screwdriver and my pliers
at your bear,” answered the man on the telegraph
pole. “I hit him on the nose. I thought he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
a wild bear after me, or I never would have done
it. I did not see any men with him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess Dido will forgive you for hitting
him,” spoke George. “Come on down,
Dido, if the man is afraid of you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not afraid any more,” the telephone
man said, laughing.</p>

<p>Dido came down, and had his breakfast with
George and Tom. Afterward the telephone man
climbed down, and gave Dido a piece of pie
from his dinner pail.</p>

<p>“That is to pay you because I hit you on the
nose,” said the man. “I am very sorry, and so
I give you this little treat.”</p>

<p>And I think Dido understood, and forgave
the man. For the dancing bear ate the pie, and
then, when George told him to, Dido let the lineman
pat him on the head.</p>

<p>“Now we will travel on again,” said George
after a bit, and away he and Tom went with
Dido, blowing nice tooting tunes on the brass
horn, and giving a dancing-bear show wherever
they could find a crowd of persons with money
to toss into the hat.</p>

<p>All through the long summer days Dido traveled
about with his masters, and then one day
there came a change. One night, after he had
danced many times that day, Dido and his masters
stopped at a hotel. Dido was allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
sleep out in the stable where there were no horses
to be frightened, while Tom and George went
in the hotel to eat.</p>

<p>The next morning Dido saw a strange man
with his masters when they came out to the stable
to feed him.</p>

<p>“There is our dancing bear,” said George to
the new man. “Do you think you would like to
buy him?”</p>

<p>“If he can do all the tricks you say he can I
may,” answered the other man.</p>

<p>“I will show you what tricks he can do,” spoke
George. “Come, Dido, here is a sweet cracker
for you. Now do your tricks.”</p>

<p>So out in front of the stable Dido danced,
marched like a soldier and turned somersaults.</p>

<p>“Those are good tricks,” said the strange man.
“I will buy your bear and take him to a circus.
There I will have him do tricks in the ring. Do
you think he will?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered George. “He was in a
circus once before, but for only a little while.
Perhaps he may remember about it.”</p>

<p>The three men went back to the hotel, leaving
some buns for Dido to eat. And the dancing
bear wondered what was going to happen to him.</p>

<p>Pretty soon George came out to where Dido
was chained in the stable. George gave Dido a
piece of berry pie, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-by, Dido. Tom and I are going to
sell you to this circus man. But he will be good
and kind to you, and teach you new tricks. So
go with him and be a good bear. Tom and I
are going back to the mountains of our own
country, and perhaps we will catch more bears.
Good-by, Dido.”</p>

<p>Tom came out, and blew a sad little tune on
the brass horn. Then he too said good-by to
Dido, and the two men who had traveled around
with Dido so many months went away. Dido
ran after them as far as his chain would let him,
and then he lay down and put his head between
his paws.</p>

<p>Animals don’t cry, of course, but they can feel
sad when their kind masters or mistresses go
away, and I am sure Dido felt sad. Dogs sometimes
feel so badly at being parted from their
masters that they will not eat.</p>

<p>But Dido was not that way. A little later,
when the circus man came out to the stable with
a nice piece of fish for the dancing bear, Dido
ate it and was very glad to get it.</p>

<p>“Now, Dido,” said the man, “you are my bear,
and I will be good to you. We are not going
about the country any more, to let you go dancing
in the streets and fields. You are going to
perform in a circus ring, under a tent, something
like you did before, and I think you will like it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came a not very happy time for Dido.
He was put in a big box, something like the trap
in which he had been caught. But this box was
larger, as Dido was a big bear now, and the box
had water in it, and nice things to eat.</p>

<p>Then the box, with Dido in, was put on a
wagon and taken to the railroad station, where
it was lifted on a train. Dido slept as much as
he could, for he did not like to travel that way.
He would much rather have tramped through
the woods and over the fields. But soon his
journey was at an end.</p>

<p>Still in his box he was taken from the train,
and when the box was opened Dido found himself
in what he thought at first was a big white
house. In it were many other animals, in cages,
as Dido could see, and he could smell other animals
whom he could not see.</p>

<p>Dido walked out and rolled over in a pile of
straw. It felt so good to be out of that cage,
that he wanted to laugh—and that is the way all
animals laugh. Then the dancing bear heard a
voice saying close to his ear:</p>

<p>“Well, I do believe it’s my old friend Dido,
whom I met in Madison Square Garden, New
York City! Aren’t you Dido, the dancing
bear?”</p>

<p>“That’s who I am,” answered Dido, standing
up, “and you are—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tum Tum, the jolly elephant,” was the answer.
“I’m glad to see you again.”</p>

<p>Dido looked around, and there, surely enough,
was Tum Tum, holding out his long nose, or
trunk. Dido rubbed noses with him.</p>

<p>“How did you get here?” asked Tum Tum.</p>

<p>“Oh, my masters sold me to another man, and
he said he was going to put me in a circus. I
guess this is it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, this is the circus,” answered Tum Tum.
“Only it is traveling around now, instead of
staying for weeks at a time in New York. We
go to a new city every day, and we have a big
tent instead of Madison Square Garden to act
in. This white house you see over us is a tent.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a tent, eh?” said Dido. “Well, it is quite
nice.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is nice except in cold weather,” said
the elephant, who not having fur, could not
stand cold as bears can. “In the winter there
is no circus in a tent,” said Tum Tum.</p>

<p>“What do you do in winter?” asked Dido.</p>

<p>“Oh, when it is time for the snow and ice the
circus goes, I have been told, up to a place where
we stay in big, warm barns until summer comes
again.”</p>

<p>Tum Tum told Dido many things about the
circus, for which I have not space in this book.
And Dido also learned many new things. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
learned to sleep in a cage on wheels, in which he
was drawn about the country, or put on big, flat
railroad cars to be pulled from place to place.
This was when the circus traveled, which was,
nearly always, at night.</p>

<p>And Dido’s new master taught him many new
tricks which the dancing bear did in the circus
ring, besides doing the ones George had taught
him. Dido learned to ride on a bicycle, he
learned to walk across a long pole, that was resting
on two barrels. He learned to roll over and
over inside a barrel, and he learned to let a dog
sit on his back and be given a ride.</p>

<p>Dido liked it very much in the circus, and he
made many friends, not only among the animals
but among the circus folk, for Dido was a gentle
bear.</p>

<p>But best of all Dido liked Tum Tum, the jolly
elephant.</p>

<p>“I met a friend of yours while I was out traveling,”
said Dido to the circus elephant one day.</p>

<p>“Who was it?” asked Tum Tum.</p>

<p>“Don, the runaway dog.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do tell me about him,” begged Tum
Tum, as he ate a bag of peanuts a little girl held
out to him. So Dido told about meeting Don.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>DIDO IN A FIRE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“What else did you do besides meeting
Don?” asked Tum Tum, when the
dancing bear had finished telling
about the runaway dog.</p>

<p>“Oh, many things happened to me,” said Dido.
“I had many adventures, as many, I think, as
would fill a book.”</p>

<p>“Who knows?” asked Tum Tum. “Perhaps
they will be put in a book. I never thought my
adventures would be printed, but they were.
Just you wait.”</p>

<p>So Dido waited, and while he waited the circus
went on from place to place. People came
into the big tent to look at the animals, and watch
those who, like Dido, did tricks. Very often
Dido’s new master would think up a different
trick for Dido to do, and the bear was very anxious
to please.</p>

<p>There was one trick Dido learned to do which
he did not like at all, at first. This was jumping
through a big wooden ring which had little jets
of fire all around it. At least Dido thought it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
was fire, for the jets glowed brightly, though
they were not hot.</p>

<p>At first when his master brought out this glowing,
blazing hoop, or ring, Dido shrank away
from it. But his master stood on the other side
of it, holding out an apple and a bun. Dido
wanted both, very much, but when he walked
around the outside of the hoop, instead of
leaping through it to get the treat, his master put
them away.</p>

<p>“No, no, Dido,” he said. “To get the apple
and bun you must jump through the hoop.
Come on. It won’t hurt you. You know I
would never do anything to hurt you.”</p>

<p>So, after a bit, <a href="#i_frontis">Dido did jump through the
blazing hoop to get the apple</a>, and he found he
was not hurt in the least, nor burned. And,
later on, he learned that around the hoop were
only tiny electric lights, like those which are
sometimes put on Christmas trees in place of
candles, and these lights you can hold in your
hand without feeling any heat.</p>

<p>So Dido learned a new trick, and when he did
it the people in the circus tent clapped their
hands loudly. By this time Dido had learned
that this meant they were pleased with him.</p>

<p>The people also clapped when Tum Tum did
his tricks, and one day Tum Tum and Dido performed
a trick together. They had to practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
it a long while, though, before it was well done.
And this was the trick:</p>

<p>On the broad, strong back of the jolly elephant
was built a platform of boards. It was square,
and made so it could be lifted on and off, being
fastened on by broad straps, as are the little
houses on the elephants’ backs in circus parades.</p>

<p>By means of a little ladder Dido and his new
master could climb up to this platform on Tum
Tum’s back, and there, as the big elephant
marched around the ring, Dido did his dance,
while the man played on the same horn that Tom
had used.</p>

<p>Around and around on the platform up on the
back of Tum Tum, the jolly elephant, rode Dido
and his master. Dido did such a funny dance
that he made the children laugh.</p>

<p>“You are a very good bear,” said his master,
patting him and giving him two buns, one extra.</p>

<p>Dido did many other tricks in the circus as it
went from place to place. But now the weather
was getting cooler.</p>

<p>“We shall soon go to our Winter quarters,”
said Tum Tum. “And then for some time we
will stay in the same place, night after night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind traveling,” spoke Dido.
“I rather like it.”</p>

<p>One day, as Dido was asleep in his cage after
having done his tricks, he heard a noise near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
edge of the tent. It was a mewing, crying sort
of noise, and, the first thing Dido knew, something
small and black scrambled into his cage
and hid down among the straw.</p>

<p>“Hello there!” called Dido, in animal language.
“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m Blackie,” was the answer. “Please
don’t drive me out.”</p>

<p>“Of course I won’t drive you out,” said Dido
kindly. “But who are you, and why is your
name Blackie?”</p>

<p>“I am a cat, and I am called Blackie because
I am black,” was the answer, and then a cat
stuck her head out from under the straw in
Dido’s cage, where he always went to rest after
having done his tricks.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you?” asked Dido.
“You seem frightened.”</p>

<p>“I am frightened,” said Blackie. “A lot of
bad boys were chasing me and throwing stones
at me. I ran as fast as I could, but they nearly
caught me. But I saw this big white house and
I ran in it. Then I saw a place to hide under
the straw in your cage-wagon, and I jumped up
here.”</p>

<p>“And you are very welcome,” said Dido
kindly. “I am glad you got away from the boys.
But this is not a white house, though I thought
it was myself, at first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Blackie.</p>

<p>“It is a circus tent. If you like you may
stay and see me do my tricks.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I would like to stay,” spoke
Blackie, “but you see I am trying to find my way
home. I am lost.”</p>

<p>“Lost!” exclaimed Dido. “That’s what happened
to Don, the runaway dog. He knows
Tum Tum, our jolly elephant.”</p>

<p>“Was Don lost?” asked Blackie.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he found his home again.”</p>

<p>“I hope I do,” said Blackie. “I used to live
with a very nice little boy and girl, who treated
me kindly, and gave me warm milk for breakfast.
One day I strayed too far off, went in a
vacant house and was locked in. I found my
way to the roof and, later, met a good lady who
cared for me. She took me out to the country
in a basket, but when the cover came loose I
jumped out, thinking I could find my way back
home alone. But I can’t seem to, and I’ve
walked ever and ever so far. Then these boys
chased me and I ran in here.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish I could help you, but I can’t
leave the circus,” said Dido. “Here is a bit of
fish I didn’t need; you may have that, and perhaps
you will feel better after eating.”</p>

<p>Blackie did. She thanked Dido very much
and went to sleep in the straw of the bear’s cage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
One of the animal men saw her and gave her
some milk to drink.</p>

<p>“Can’t you really stay and see me do some
tricks?” asked Dido.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” spoke Blackie. “I’ll just
peep out of this tent, as you call it, and if the
boys are gone I’ll trot along. Maybe I shall
find my home to-day.”</p>

<p>Blackie looked out under the tent. She saw
no boys.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” called the lost cat to Dido. “I’m
going away.”</p>

<p>“I hope you find your home, and that I see you
again,” said Dido. “Good-by!”</p>

<p>In a few more weeks the weather grew quite
cool, and one day the big circus tent was taken
down for the last time, the cages were put on the
cars, and the circus started on a long journey.</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” asked Dido of Tum
Tum.</p>

<p>“To the big barns I told you about,” answered
the jolly elephant. “We are going into winter
quarters.”</p>

<p>And, a few days later, there is where Dido
found himself. He was still kept in his cage,
which was in a big barn with many other cages
of animals. There were horses and elephants in
the barn, Tum Tum being there, of course.</p>

<p>Dido did not have to do his tricks every day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
now. But once a week or so his master came to
put him through them, to see that the bear had
not forgotten how to dance, or turn somersaults.</p>

<p>It was nice and warm in the big circus barn,
and the animals had enough to eat, so they had
a very good time of it.</p>

<p>“Still I liked traveling about the country with
George and Tom,” said Dido. “It was real
jolly sleeping out of doors, except when it rained.
And I like going about with the circus, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will be able to go about again,” said
Tum Tum. “When warm weather comes we
shall travel once more.”</p>

<p>But something happened which nearly stopped
all the circus animals from ever traveling about
the country again.</p>

<p>One night Dido was awakened in his cage by
a queer smell. And there was a funny feeling in
his nose and throat as if he wanted to sneeze.</p>

<p>Dido stood up in his cage and looked across
the barn. He saw smoke, and he knew what
smoke was, for he had often seen Tom and
George make a fire in the woods to boil coffee.
And Dido saw fire with the smoke. Then he
knew what the queer smell was that had made
him want to sneeze. It was the smoke in his
nose.</p>

<p>The fire grew brighter and the smoke thicker.
Dido stood close to the bars of his cage and called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to Tum Tum, who was asleep standing up, as
elephants often do.</p>

<p>“Tum Tum!” called Dido in animal talk, “the
circus barn is on fire! The barn is on fire!
What shall we do?”</p>

<p>Tum Tum awoke with a start. He looked at
the fire, which was in one end of the barn,
farthest off from the animal cages.</p>

<p>“Oh, my! A fire!” cried Tum Tum. “That
is terrible! We must get out somehow!”</p>

<p>“That is easy for you to do,” cried Dido, “for
you are not in a cage. But what shall I do?”</p>

<p>“We must call to the circus men to come and
let you caged animals out,” said Tum Tum.
“I’ll call,” and he made a loud trumpet noise.</p>

<p>“They had better hurry,” said Dido. “The
fire is growing hotter. Once my masters made
a fire in the woods, and it spread in the dry leaves
so they had to get water and put it out. Oh,
Tum Tum, can’t you let me out of my cage?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tum Tum, “I will. I can open
many animal cages with my trunk.” Tum Tum
was a trick elephant and could do many things.
<a href="#i_p117">He soon had opened the cage of the dancing
bear, and Dido could jump out.</a> By this time
the other animals were much excited by the fire.
Some of them broke out of their cages by themselves.
Others Tum Tum let out, helped by
Dido.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“But we must get out of the burning circus
barn,” Dido said. “To be out of our cages will
do us no good unless we get out of the barn, too.”</p>

<p>Tum Tum, and the other elephants and other
animals, ran around the inside of the circus barn,
looking for an open door. But there was none.
All the doors and windows were tightly fastened
to keep out the cold.</p>

<p>By this time men could be heard outside shouting
about the fire. Dido ran up to one door.
This led outside, as he knew, for he had come in
and out of it several times.</p>

<p>“Tum Tum!” called the dancing bear, “if we
could break open this door we could get out and
let the other animals out too. Let us try to break
down the door.”</p>

<p>“All right!” cried Tum Tum. “I will bang
it with my strong head. Look out! Here I
come!”</p>

<p>Tum Tum backed up a little way. Then he
ran at the door and struck it with his head. At
first it would not open. But when Tum Tum
struck it again and again, and when Dido hit on
it with his powerful paws, the door began to
splinter and crack.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried the other animals. “Dido and
Tum Tum will now let us out of the burning
barn!”</p>

<p>Dido and Tum Tum banged on the door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
With his paws Dido pulled away the splinters
and pieces of wood that Tum Tum broke off
with his head. Soon there was room for all the
animals to go out.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Tum Tum. And he and
Dido let all the other animals run out first and
then they went out. And it was high time, too,
for the barn was blazing very hot and fast
now.</p>

<p>Then men came up with hoses to squirt water
on the fire, while other men drove the animals
to another barn where they could stay for a
while.</p>

<p>“All the animals saved!” cried the head circus
man when the fire was out. “That’s fine! I
wonder how they got out of the barn.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dido and Tum Tum let them out,” said
one of the trainers. “I saw the elephant and
bear break down the door.”</p>

<p>Then the circus folk, as well as the animals,
loved Dido and Tum Tum more than ever.
Soon the burned barn was built over new, and
it was better than before. Dido stayed in it all
winter and when spring came again he and
Tum Tum started out with the circus show
again.</p>

<p>I wish I had space to tell you other adventures
of Dido, the dancing bear, but this book is quite
filled, as you may see. And Dido did finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
get into a book, didn’t he? I hope he likes what
I have written about him, if he ever sees it.</p>

<p>But if I can not tell you any more about Dido
I can about Blackie, the cat who hid in the bear’s
cage. So the next book will be named “Blackie,
a Lost Cat: Her Many Adventures.” And I
hope you will like what I have to write about
her.</p>

<p>“Tum Tum,” said Dido one day as he was
dancing on the platform on the elephant’s back,
“do you remember the fire?”</p>

<p>“I should say I <em>did</em>,” answered Tum Tum.
“I never want to see another.”</p>

<p>“Nor do I,” spoke Dido, as he whirled about
while his circus master tooted a gay tune on the
brass horn.</p>

<p>Then Dido turned somersaults in the circus
ring, jumped through the lighted hoop and did
many other tricks.</p>

<p>And now let us all say:</p>

<p>“Good-by, Dido!”</p>

<p>In all nursery literature animals have
played a conspicuous part; and the reason
is obvious, for nothing entertains a child
more than the antics of an animal. These
stories abound in amusing incidents such
as children adore, and the characters are
so full of life, so appealing to a child’s
imagination, that none will be satisfied until
they have met all of their favorites—Squinty,
Slicko, Mappo, and the rest.</p>
